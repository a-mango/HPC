a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in thatrefined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought andwith the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importancewho had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovnakissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining headand complacently seated himself on the sofafirst of all dear friend tell

what has been decided about novosiltsevsdispatch you know everythingwhat can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listlesstone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte hasburnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn oursprince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stalepart anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty yearsoverflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and sometimes even when she did notfeel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though itdid not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressedas in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defectwhich she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary tocorrectin the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burstoutoh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understandthings but austria never has wished and does not wish for war sheis betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereignrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that

her commercialspirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexandersloftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted tofind and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answerdid novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannotunderstand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing forhimself but only desires the good of mankind and what have theypromised nothing and what little they have promised they will notperform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible andthat all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe aword that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussianneutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the loftydestiny of our adored monarch he will save europeshe suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosityi think said the prince with a smile that if you had beensent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the kingof prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give mea cup of teain a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i amexpecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart whois connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the bestfrench families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones andalso the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has beenreceived by the emperor had you heardi shall be delighted to meet them said the prince buttell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only justoccurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chiefmotive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wantsbaron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by allaccounts is a poor creatureprince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others weretrying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it forthe baronanna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she noranyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or waspleased withbaron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by hersister was all she said in a dry and mournful toneas she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funkebeaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadnessthe prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly andcourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovnawished both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a manrecommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so shesaidnow about your family do you know that since your daughter cameout everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazinglybeautifulthe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitudei often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearerto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that politicaland social topics were ended and the time had come for intimateconversationi often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of lifeare distributed why has fate given you two such splendid childreni dont speak of anatole your youngest i dont like him sheadded in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrowstwo such charming children and really you appreciate them less thananyone and so you dont deserve to have themand she smiled her ecstatic smilei cant help it said the prince lavater would have said ilack the bump of paternitydont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you knowi am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and herface assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at hermajestys and you were pitiedthe prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantlyawaiting a reply he frownedwhat would you have me do he said at last you know i did alla father could for their education and they have both turned out foolshippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one thatis the only difference between them he said this smiling in a waymore natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles roundhis mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse andunpleasantand why are children born to such men as you if you were not afather there would be nothing i could reproach you with said annapavlovna looking up pensivelyi am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear thatis how i explain it to myself it cant be helpedhe said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture anna pavlovna meditatedhave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole sheasked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though idont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person whois very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princessmary bolkonskayaprince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory andperception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement ofthe head that he was considering this informationdo you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be infive years if he goes on like this presently he added thatswhat we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yoursrichher father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he isthe wellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army underthe late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he isvery clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl

woman in petersburgto each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen myaunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conductedhim or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in hercap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guestsbegan to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to heraunt anna pavlovna mentioned each ones name and then left themeach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom notone of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of themcared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful andsolemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them inthe same words about their health and her own and the health of hermajesty who thank god was better today and each visitorthough politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old womanwith a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did notreturn to her the whole eveningthe young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in agoldembroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which adelicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teethbut it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when sheoccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the casewith a thoroughly attractive woman her defectthe shortness of herupper lip and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special andpeculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this prettyyoung woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health andcarrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young oneswho looked at her after being in her company and talking to her alittle while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of lifeand health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smileand the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in aspecially amiable mood that daythe little princess went round the table with quick short swayingsteps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress satdown on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was apleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my worksaid she in french displaying her bag and addressing all presentmind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on meshe added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quitea small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and shespread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty graydress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breastsoyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyoneelse replied anna pavlovnayou know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still infrench turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is goingto get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for sheadded addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer sheturned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helenewhat a delightful woman this little princess is said princevasili to anna pavlovnaone of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man withclosecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionableat that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stoutyoung man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a wellknowngrandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young manhad not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had onlyjust returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was hisfirst appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod sheaccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite ofthis lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sightof something too large and unsuited to the place came over her facewhen she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger thanthe other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference tothe clever though shy but observant and natural expression whichdistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing roomit is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poorinvalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with heraunt as she conducted him to herpierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round asif in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the littleprincess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintanceanna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from theaunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys healthanna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know theabbe morio he is a most interesting manyes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is veryinteresting but hardly feasibleyou think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say somethingand get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre nowcommitted a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady beforeshe had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak toanother who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feetspread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbesplan chimericalwe will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smileand having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave sheresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch readyto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag asthe foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goesround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one thatcreaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check themachine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about herdrawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by aword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steadyproper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety aboutpierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approachedthe group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there andagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbepierre had been educated abroad and this reception at annapavlovnas was the first he had attended in russia he knew that allthe intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like achild in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missingany clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the selfconfidentand refined expression on the faces of those present he was alwaysexpecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to moriohere the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for anopportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doingchapter iiianna pavlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the auntbeside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company hadsettled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed roundthe abbe another of young people was grouped round the beautifulprincess helene prince vasilis daughter and the little princessbolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her agethe third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovnathe vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polishedmanners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out ofpoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up asa treat to her guests as a clever maitre dhotel serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it inthe kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna served up toher guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choicemorsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing themurder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc denghienhad perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particularreasons for buonapartes hatred of himah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovnawith a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in thesound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomtethe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness tocomply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone tolisten to his talethe vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna toone of the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said sheto another how evidently he belongs to the best society said sheto a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beefon a hot dishthe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smilecome over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center ofanother groupthe princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with whichshe had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautifulwoman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with mossand ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparklingdiamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not lookingat any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each theprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shouldersback and bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very muchexposedand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her asshe moved toward anna pavlovna helene was so lovely that not onlydid she not show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she evenappeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty sheseemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effecthow lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted hisshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinarywhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with herunchanging smilemadame i doubt my ability before such an audience said hesmilingly inclining his headthe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considereda reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story wasbeing told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round armaltered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still morebeautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from timeto time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the storyproduced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted justthe expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsedinto her radiant smilethe little princess had also left the tea table and followed helenewait a moment ill get my work now then what are youthinking of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me myworkbagthere was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in herseatnow i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her workprince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle andmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside herle charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblanceto his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite ofthis resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like hissisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyousselfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by thewonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrarywas dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullenselfconfidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose andmouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his armsand legs always fell into unnatural positionsits not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speakwhy no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shouldersbecause i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered themhe spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be surewhether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed ina darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nympheeffrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockingsthe vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then currentto the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris tovisit mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonapartewho also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presencenapoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he wassubject and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter spared him andthis magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by deaththe story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies lookedagitatedcharming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princesscharming whispered the little princess sticking the needle intoher work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the storyprevented her from going on with itthe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he wastalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to therescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe aboutthe balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the youngmans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory bothwere talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was whyanna pavlovna disapprovedthe means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russiabarbaric as she is said to beto placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its objectthe maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save theworldbut how are you to get that balance pierre was beginningat that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely at pierreasked the italian how he stood russian climate the italiansface instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugaryexpression evidently habitual to him when conversing with womeni am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i have hadthe honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think ofthe climate said henot letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circlechapter ivjust then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrewbolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome youngman of medium height with firm clearcut features everything abouthim from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured stepoffered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it wasevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but hadfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen tothem and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemedto bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away fromher with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed annapavlovnas hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole companyyou are off to the war prince said anna pavlovnageneral kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressingthe last syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has beenpleased to take me as an aidedecampand lise your wifeshe will go to the countryare you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wifeandre said his wife addressing her husband in the samecoquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte hasbeen telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparteprince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who fromthe moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with gladaffectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked roundprince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever wastouching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming face he gave him anunexpectedly kind and pleasant smilethere now so you too are in the great world said he topierrei knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supperwith you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb thevicomte who was continuing his storyno impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressingpierres hand to show that there was no need to ask the question hewished to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and hisdaughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them passyou must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to thefrenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to preventhis rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives meof a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leaveyour enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovnahis daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightlyholding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still moreradiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturousalmost frightened eyes as she passed himvery lovely said prince andrewvery said pierrein passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to annapavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with mea whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in societynothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of cleverwomenanna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew hisfather to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady whohad been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook princevasili in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumedhad left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxietyand fearhow about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him intothe anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me whatnews i may take back to my poor boyalthough prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politelyto the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him aningratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not goawaywhat would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then hewould be transferred to the guards at once said shebelieve me princess i am ready to do all i can answered princevasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i shouldadvise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that wouldbe the best waythe elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of thebest families in russia but she was poor and having long been out ofsociety had lost her former influential connections she had now come topetersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only sonit was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained aninvitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat listening tothe vicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened her anembittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a momentthen she smiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightlylisten to me prince said she i have never yet asked youfor anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of myfathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake todo this for my sonand i shall always regard you as a benefactorshe added hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have askedgolitsyn and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always wereshe said trying to smile though tears were in her eyespapa we shall be late said princess helene turning herbeautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as shestood waiting by the doorinfluence in society however is a capital which has to be economizedif it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realizedthat if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon beunable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence butin princess drubetskayas case he felt after her second appealsomething like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what wasquite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps inhis career moreover he could see by her manners that she was one ofthose womenmostly motherswho having once made up their mindswill not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared ifnecessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and evento make scenes this last consideration moved himmy dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual

my dear benefactorpapa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as beforewe shall be latewell au revoir goodby you hear herthen tomorrow you will speak to the emperorcertainly but about kutuzov i dont promisedo promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as hewent with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probablycame naturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn faceapparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employedall the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her faceresumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to thegroup where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended tolisten while waiting till it would be time to leave her task wasaccomplishedchapter vand what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation atmilan asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people ofgenoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte andmonsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions ofthe nations adorable it is enough to make ones head whirl it is asif the whole world had gone crazyprince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with asarcastic smiledieu me la donne gare a qui la touche they say he wasvery fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words initalian dio mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi god has given it to me let him who touches it bewarei hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass runover anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able toendure this man who is a menace to everythingthe sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte politebut hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louisxvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he becamemore animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of theirbetrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sendingambassadors to compliment the usurperand sighing disdainfully he again changed his positionprince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some timethrough his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward thelittle princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the condecoat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravityas if she had asked him to do itbaton de gueules engrele de gueules dazurmaison condesaid hethe princess listened smilingif buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer thevicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with whichhe is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others butfollows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone toofar by intrigues violence exile and executions french societyimean good french societywill have been forever destroyed andthenhe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished tomake a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovnawho had him under observation interruptedthe emperor alexander said she with the melancholy whichalways accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family hasdeclared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choosetheir own form of government and i believe that once free from theusurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the armsof its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to theroyalist emigrantthat is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quiterightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it willbe difficult to return to the old regimefrom what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking intothe conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over tobonapartes sideit is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte withoutlooking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know thereal state of french public opinionbonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcasticsmileit was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming hisremarks at him though without looking at himi showed them the path to glory but they did not followit prince andrew continued after a short silence again quotingnapoleons words i opened my antechambers and they crowdedin i do not know how far he was justified in saying sonot in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of theduc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to somepeople he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a heroafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and onehero less on earthbefore anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile theirappreciation of the vicomtes epigram pierre again broke into theconversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say somethinginappropriate she was unable to stop himthe execution of the duc denghien declared monsieur pierrewas a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleonshowed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the wholeresponsibility of that deeddieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisperwhat monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination showsgreatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing herwork nearer to heroh oh exclaimed several voicescapital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping hisknee with the palm of his handthe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at hisaudience over his spectacles and continuedi say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fledfrom the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon aloneunderstood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general goodhe could not stop short for the sake of one mans lifewont you come over to the other table suggested annapavlovnabut pierre continued his speech without heeding herno cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is greatbecause he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abusespreserved all that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedomof speech and of the pressand only for that reason did he obtainpoweryes if having obtained power without availing himself of it tocommit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should havecalled him a great man remarked the vicomtehe could not do that the people only gave him power that he mightrid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a greatman the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierrebetraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extremeyouth and his wish to express all that was in his mindwhat revolution and regicide a grand thing well after thatbut wont you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovnarousseaus contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerantsmilei am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideasyes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected anironical voicethose were extremes no doubt but they are not what is mostimportant what is important are the rights of man emancipation fromprejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleonhas retained in full forceliberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if atlast deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his wordswere highsounding words which have long been discredited who doesnot love liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty andequality have people since the revolution become happier on thecontrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed itprince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to thevicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment ofpierres outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience washorrorstruck but when she saw that pierres sacrilegious wordshad not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it wasimpossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte ina vigorous attack on the oratorbut my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain thefact of a great man executing a ducor even an ordinary man whoisinnocent and untriedi should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explainsthe th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and notat all like the conduct of a great manand the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said thelittle princess shrugging her shouldershes a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolytepierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled hissmile was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiledhis grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced byanothera childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed toask forgivenessthe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly thatthis young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all weresilenthow do you expect him to answer you all at once said princeandrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguishbetween his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperorso it seems to meyes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival ofthis reinforcementone must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a manwas great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where hegave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other actswhich it is difficult to justifyprince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness ofpierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time togosuddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attendand asking them all to be seated begani was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to itexcuse me vicomtei must tell it in russian or the point will belost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russianas a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russiaeveryone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand theirattention to his storythere is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she musthave two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was hertaste and she had a ladys maid also big she saidhere prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas withdifficultyshe said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on alivery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make somecallshere prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before hisaudience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator severalpersons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did howeversmileshe went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat andher long hair came down here he could contain himself nolonger and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole worldknewand so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had toldit or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and theothers appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeablyending pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdotethe conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the lastand next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when andwherechapter vihaving thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests beganto take their leavepierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with hugered hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawingroom and still less how to leave one that is how to say somethingparticularly agreeable before going away besides this he wasabsentminded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own thegenerals threecornered hat and held it pulling at the plumetill the general asked him to restore it all his absentmindedness andinability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed byhis kindly simple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned towardhim and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of hisindiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i alsohope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierrewhen she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybodysaw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions areopinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow i am andeveryone including anna pavlovna felt thisprince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shouldersto the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listenedindifferently to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had alsocome into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnantprincess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglassgo in annette or you will catch cold said the little princesstaking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a lowvoiceanna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match shecontemplated between anatole and the little princess sisterinlawi rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tonewrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter aurevoir and she left the hallprince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his faceclose to her began to whisper somethingtwo footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl anda cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened tothe french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air ofunderstanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usualspoke smilingly and listened with a laughi am very glad i did not go to the ambassadors said princehippolyte so dull it has been a delightful evening has itnot delightfulthey say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawingup her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will betherenot all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolytesmiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom heeven pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either fromawkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after theshawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time asthough embracing herstill smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at herhusband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did heseemare you ready he asked his wife looking past herprince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashionreached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porchfollowing the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriageprincesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as wellas with his feetthe princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the darkcarriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte underpretense of helping was in everyones wayallow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a colddisagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his pathi am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently andaffectionatelythe postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolytelaughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomtewhom he had promised to take homewell mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself besidehippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice verynice indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingershippolyte burst out laughingdo you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airscontinued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officerwho gives himself the airs of a monarchhippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you weresaying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has toknow how to deal with thempierre reaching the house first went into prince andrews study likeone quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa tookfrom the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesarscommentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middlewhat have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill nowsaid prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small whitehandspierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eagerface to prince andrew smiled and waved his handthat abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in theright light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible buti do notknow how to express it not by a balance of political powerit was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstractconversationone cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well haveyou at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or adiplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silencepierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under himreally i dont yet know i dont like either the one or theotherbut you must decide on something your father expects itpierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutorand had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscowhis father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now goto petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree toanything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money writeto me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre hadalready been choosing a career for three months and had not decidedon anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speakingpierre rubbed his foreheadbut he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whomhe had met that eveningthat is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him letus talk business have you been to the horse guardsno i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wantedto tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war forfreedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the armybut to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world isnot rightprince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierres childish wordshe put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to suchnonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any otheranswer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive questionif no one fought except on his own conviction there would be nowars he saidand that would be splendid said pierreprince andrew smiled ironicallyvery likely it would be splendid but it will never come aboutwell why are you going to the war asked pierrewhat for i dont know i must besides that i am going hepaused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suitmechapter viithe rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room princeandrew shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look ithad had in anna pavlovnas drawing room pierre removed his feet fromthe sofa the princess came in she had changed her gown for a housedress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politelyplaced a chair for herhow is it she began as usual in french settling down brisklyand fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got marriedhow stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for sayingso but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow youare monsieur pierreand i am still arguing with your husband i cant understand why hewants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princesswith none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in theirintercourse with young womenthe princess started evidently pierres words touched her to thequickah that is just what i tell him said she i dontunderstand it i dont in the least understand why men cant livewithout wars how is it that we women dont want anything of the kinddont need it now you shall judge between us i always tell him herehe is uncles aidedecamp a most brilliant position he is sowell known so much appreciated by everyone the other day at theapraksins i heard a lady asking is that the famous princeandrew i did indeed she laughed he is so well receivedeverywhere he might easily become aidedecamp to the emperor you knowthe emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking ofhow to arrange it what do you thinkpierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like theconversation gave no replywhen are you starting he askedoh dont speak of his going dont i wont hear it spokenof said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in whichshe had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainlyillsuited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a membertoday when i remembered that all these delightful associationsmust be broken off and then you know andre she lookedsignificantly at her husband im afraid im afraid shewhispered and a shudder ran down her backher husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besidespierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone offrigid politenesswhat is it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said hethere what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whimof his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alonein the countrywith my father and sister remember said prince andrew gentlyalone all the same without my friends and he expects me not tobe afraidher tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not ajoyful but an animal squirrellike expression she paused as if shefelt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though thegist of the matter lay in thati still cant understand what you are afraid of said princeandrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wifethe princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despairno andrew i must say you have changed oh how you haveyour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrewyou had better gothe princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quiveredprince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the roompierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him andnow at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mindwhy should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the littleprincess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearfulgrimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changedso to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have nopity for me why is itlise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressedan entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herselfregret her words but she went on hurriedlyyou treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behavelike that six months agolise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still moreemphaticallypierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened toall this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear thesight of tears and was ready to cry himselfcalm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure youi myself have experienced and so because no excuse mean outsider is out of place here no dont distress yourselfgoodbyprince andrew caught him by the handno wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me ofthe pleasure of spending the evening with youno he thinks only of himself muttered the princess withoutrestraining her angry tearslise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitchwhich indicates that patience is exhaustedsuddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess prettyface changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyesglanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timiddeprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags itsdrooping tailmon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with onehand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the foreheadgood night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her handas he would have done to a strangerchapter viiithe friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierrecontinually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his foreheadwith his small handlet us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the doorthey entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining roomeverything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass borethat imprint of newness found in the households of the newly marriedhalfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table andwith a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen onhis face began to talkas one who has long had something on his mindand suddenly determines to speak outnever never marry my dear fellow thats my advice never marrytill you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable ofand until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seenher plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocablemistake marry when you are old and good for nothingor all that isgood and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on triflesyes yes yes dont look at me with such surprise if you marryexpecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at everystep that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawingroom where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and anidiot but whats the good and he waved his armpierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different andthe goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friendin amazementmy wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman oneof those rare women with whom a mans honor is safe but o god whatwould i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one towhom i mention this because i like youas he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonskiwho had lolled in anna pavlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosedeyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of histhin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in whichthe fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliantlight it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinarytimes the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbidirritationyou dont understand why i say this he continued but it isthe whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career saidhe though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte whenhe worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothingbut his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up witha woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all youhave of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you withregret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese arethe enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the warthe greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit fornothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued princeandrew and at anna pavlovnas they listen to me and that stupidset without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you onlyknew what those society women are and women in general my father isright selfish vain stupid trivial in everythingthats whatwomen are when you see them in their true colors when you meet themin society it seems as if there were something in them but theresnothing nothing nothing no dont marry my dear fellow dontmarry concluded prince andrewit seems funny to me said pierre that you you shouldconsider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you haveeverything before you everything and youhe did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly hethought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the futurehow can he talk like that thought pierre he considered hisfriend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in thehighest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which mightbe best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished atprince andrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinarymemory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everythingand had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity forwork and study and if pierre was often struck by andrews lackof capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself wasparticularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as asign of strengtheven in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praiseand commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheelsthat they may run smoothlymy part is played out said prince andrew whats the use oftalking about me let us talk about you he added after a silencesmiling at his reassuring thoughtsthat smile was immediately reflected on pierres facebut what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxinginto a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate sonhe suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a greateffort to say this without a name and without means and itreally but he did not say what it really was for thepresent i am free and am all right only i havent the least idea whati am to do i wanted to consult you seriouslyprince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glancefriendly andaffectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of his own superiorityi am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among ourwhole set yes youre all right choose what you will its all thesame youll be all right anywhere but look here give up visitingthose kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you sobadlyall this debauchery dissipation and the rest of itwhat would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugginghis shoulders women my dear fellow womeni dont understand it replied prince andrew women who arecomme il faut thats a different matter but the kuragins set ofwomen women and wine i dont understandpierre was staying at prince vasili kuragins and sharing thedissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning toreform by marrying him to prince andrews sisterdo you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happythought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading sucha life i cant decide or think properly about anything ones headaches and one spends all ones money he asked me for tonight but iwont goyou give me your word of honor not to goon my honorchapter ixit was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was acloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intendingto drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more hefelt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was lightenough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more likemorning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatolekuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after whichthere was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kindpierre was very fond ofi should like to go to kuragins thought hebut he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to gothere then as happens to people of weak character he desired sopassionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed tothat he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that hispromise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave ithe had already promised prince anatole to come to his gatheringbesides thought he all such words of honor areconventional things with no definite meaning especially ifone considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something soextraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all thesame pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifyingall his decisions and intentions he went to kuraginsreaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in whichanatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairsand went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom emptybottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell ofalcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distancecards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersedpierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were theremains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking onthe sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds oflaughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear andgeneral commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiouslyround an open window three others were romping with a young bear onepulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the othersi bet a hundred on stevens shouted onemind no holding on cried anotheri bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part ourhandsthere leave bruin alone heres a bet onat one draught or he loses shouted a fourthjacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellowwho stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his finelinen shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here ispetya good man cried he addressing pierreanother voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyesparticularly striking among all these drunken voices by its soberring cried from the window come here part the bets this wasdolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler andduelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about himmerrilyi dont understand whats it all aboutwait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole andtaking a glass from the table he went up to pierrefirst of all you must drinkpierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows atthe tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listeningto their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierres glass whileexplaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english navalofficer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledgeof the third floor window with his legs hanging outgo on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the lastglass or i wont let you

particularly toanatole and pierredolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue eyes hewas about twentyfive like all infantry officers he wore no mustacheso that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearlyseen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middleof the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firmlower one and something like two distinct smiles played continuallyround the two corners of the mouth this together with the resoluteinsolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made itimpossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small meansand no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands ofrubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such afooting that all who knew them including anatole himself respected himmore than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearlyalways won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadednessboth kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakesand scapegraces of petersburgthe bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyonefrom sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen whowere evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts ofthe gentlemen aroundanatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted tosmash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame butcould not move it he smashed a paneyou have a try hercules said he turning to pierrepierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out witha crashtake it right out or theyll think im holding on saiddolokhovis the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatolefirstrate said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottleof rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light ofthe sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visibledolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the windowsill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in theroom all were silenti bet fifty imperialshe spoke french that the englishman mightunderstand him but he did not speak it very welli bet fiftyimperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added headdressing the englishmanno fifty replied the latterall right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle ofrum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on thisspot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the windowand without holding on to anything is that rightquite right said the englishmananatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttonsof his coat and looking down at himthe englishman was shortbeganrepeating the terms of the wager to him in englishwait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the windowsill to attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen ifanyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do youunderstandthe englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended toaccept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and thoughhe kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translatingdolokhovs words into english a thin young lad an hussar of thelife guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the windowsill leaned over and looked downoh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at thestones of the pavementshut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window thelad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spursplacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easilydolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and loweredhis legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himselfon his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then tothe left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles andplaced them on the window sill though it was already quite lightdolokhovs back in his white shirt and his curly head were litup from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman infront pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the otherspresent suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wantedto seize hold of dolokhovs shirti say this is folly hell be killed said this more sensiblemananatole stopped himdont touch him youll startle him and then hell be killedeh what then ehdolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arrangedhimself on his seatif anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the wordsseparately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him downthere now thensaying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottleand lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free handto balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up somebroken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from thewindow and from dolokhovs back anatole stood erect with staringeyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the manwho had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threwhimself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face fromwhich a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressedhorror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyesdolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrownfurther back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the handholding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with theeffort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higherand his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thoughtpierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsedsuddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his armtrembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slipas he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head andarm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutchthe window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again coveredhis eyes and thought he would never open them again suddenly he wasaware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on thewindow sill with a pale but radiant faceits emptyhe threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhovjumped down he smelt strongly of rumwell done fine fellow theres a bet for you devil takeyou came from different

your bet tomorrowbut now we are all going to scome on then cried pierre come on and well take bruinwith usand he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the groundand began dancing round

visitors tone of condescension to childishthings she did not reply but looked at her seriouslymeanwhile the younger generation boris the officer annamikhaylovnas son nicholas the undergraduate the counts eldestson sonya the counts fifteenyearold niece and little petyahis youngest boy had all settled down in the drawing room and wereobviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitementand mirth that shone in all their faces evidently in the back roomsfrom which they had dashed out so impetuously the conversation hadbeen more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals theweather and countess apraksina now and then they glanced at oneanother hardly able to suppress their laughterthe two young men the student and the officer friends from childhoodwere of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike boriswas tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicatefeatures nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expressiondark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole faceexpressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he enteredthe drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say butfailed boris on the contrary at once found his footing and relatedquietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she wasstill quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had agedduring the five years he had known her and how her head had crackedright across the skull having said this he glanced at natashashe turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who wasscrewing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unableto control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room asfast as her nimble little feet would carry her boris did not laughyou were meaning to go out werent you mamma do you want thecarriage he asked his mother with a smileyes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answeredreturning his smileboris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha the plumpboy ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had beendisturbedchapter xiithe only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting theyoung lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was fouryears older than her sister and behaved already like a grownup personwere nicholas and sonya the niece sonya was a slender littlebrunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by longlashes thick black plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawnytint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender butgraceful and muscular arms and neck by the grace of her movementsby the softness and flexibility of her small limbs and by a certaincoyness and reserve of manner she reminded one of a pretty halfgrownkitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat she evidentlyconsidered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation bysmiling but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lasheswatched her cousin who was going to join the army with such passionategirlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant imposeupon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only tospring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon asthey too could like natasha and boris escape from the drawing roomah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor andpointing to nicholas his friend boris has become an officer andso for friendships sake he is leaving the university and me hisold father and entering the military

dining with ustoday he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with himit cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders andspeaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed himi have already told you papa said his son that if youdont wish to let me go ill stay but i know i am no use anywhereexcept in the army i am not a diplomat or a government clerkidont know how to hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancingwith the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sonya and the younglady visitorthe little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any momentto start her gambols again and display her kittenish natureall right all right said the old count he always flares upthis buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how herose from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it headded not noticing his visitors sarcastic smilethe elders began talking about bonaparte julie karagina turned toyoung rostovwhat a pity you werent at the arkharovs on thursday it was sodull without you said she giving him a tender smilethe young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettishsmile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversationwithout at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heartof sonya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talkhe glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance andhardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smileon her lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animationvanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and thenwith a distressed face left the room to find sonyahow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on theirsleeves said anna mikhaylovna pointing to nicholas as he went outcousinagedangereux voisinage she added cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhoodyes said the countess when the brightness these young people hadbrought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question noone had put but which was always in her mind and how much sufferinghow much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice inthem now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one isalways always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous bothfor girls and boysit all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitoryes youre quite right continued the countess till now ihave always thank god been my childrens friend and had their fullconfidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents whoimagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shallalways be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas withhis impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it hewill all the same never be like those petersburg young menyes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the countwho always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by decidingthat everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussarwhats one to

young replied the count why ourmothers used to be married at twelve or thirteenand shes in love with boris already just fancy said thecountess with a gentle smile looking at boris and went on evidentlyconcerned with a thought that always occupied her now you see if iwere to be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what theymight be up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissingbut as it is i know every word she utters she will come running tome of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps ispoil her but really that seems the best plan with her elder sister iwas stricteryes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsomeelder daughter countess vera with a smilebut the smile did not enhance veras beauty as smiles generally doon the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasantexpression vera was goodlooking not at all stupid quick atlearning was well brought up and had a pleasant voice what she saidwas true and appropriate yet strange to say everyonethe visitorsand countess aliketurned to look at her as if wondering why she hadsaid it and they all felt awkwardpeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try tomake something exceptional of them said the visitorwhats the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was tooclever with vera said the count well what of that shesturned out splendidly all the same he added winking at verathe guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinnerwhat manners i thought they would never go said the countesswhen she had seen her guests outchapter xiiiwhen natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as theconservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversationin the drawing room waiting for boris to come out she was alreadygrowing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not comingat once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approachingneither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among theflower tubs and hid thereboris paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a littledust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examinedhis handsome face natasha very still peered out from her ambushwaiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before theglass smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about tocall him but changed her mind let him look for me thought shehardly had boris gone than sonya flushed in tears and mutteringangrily came in at the other door natasha checked her first impulseto run out to her and remained in her hiding place watchingasunder an invisible capto see what went on in the world she wasexperiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering to herselfkept looking round toward the drawing room door it opened and nicholascame insonya what is the matter with you how can you said he runningup to herits nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sonyaah i know what it iswell if you do

i will prove it to youi dont like you to talk like thatwell then i wont only forgive me sonya he drew her to himand kissed heroh how nice thought natasha and when sonya and nicholas hadgone out of the

the tubs where she had been hidingboris followed her smilingwhat is the something asked heshe grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had throwndown on one of the tubs picked it upkiss the

up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying fromexcitementboris blushedhow funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing stillmore but he waited and did nothingsuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him sothat both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossingback her hair kissed him full on the lipsthen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubsand stood hanging her headnatasha he said you know that i love you butyou are in love with me natasha broke inyes i am but please dont let us do like that in

room she noticed two couples sittingone pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sonya wassitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her thefirst he had ever written boris and natasha were at the other windowand ceased talking when vera entered sonya and natasha looked atvera with guilty happy facesit was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love butapparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in verahow often have i asked you not to take my things she said youhave a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholasin a minute in a minute he said dipping his penyou always manage to do things at the wrong time continued verayou came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamedof youthough what she said

between natasha andboris or between you two its all nonsensenow vera what does it matter to you said natasha in defensespeaking very gentlyshe seemed that day to be more than ever kind and

ofdont boris you are such a diplomat that it is reallytiresome said natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightlyshe used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogueamong the children in the special sense they attached to it whydoes she bother me and she added turning to vera youllnever understand it because youve never loved anyone you have noheart you are a madame de genlis and nothing more this nicknamebestowed on vera by nicholas was considered very stinging andyour greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people go and flirt withberg as much as you please she finished

profound sorrow suddenlyclouded his mothers face and he smiled slightlyah prince in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is ourdear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive lookfixed on herprince vasili stared at her and at boris questioningly and perplexedboris bowed politely prince vasili without acknowledging the bowturned to anna mikhaylovna answering her query by a

crisisbut one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that thewelfare of his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of achristiana door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses thecounts niece entered with a cold stern face the length of herbody was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince vasiliturned to herwell how is hestill the same but what can you expect this noise said theprincess looking at anna mikhaylovna as at a strangerah my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikhaylovna with ahappy smile ambling lightly up to the counts niece i have comeand am at your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what youhave gone through and she sympathetically turned up her eyesthe princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room asanna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position shehad conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasili totake a seat beside herboris she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to seethe count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhileand dont forget to give him the rostovs invitation they ask himto dinner i suppose he wont go she continued turning to theprinceon the contrary replied the prince who had plainly becomedepressed i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that youngman here he is and the count has not once asked for himhe shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted boris down one flight ofstairs and up another to pierres roomschapter xvipierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself inpetersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct andsent to moscow the story told about him at count rostovs was truepierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now beenfor some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his fathershouse though he expected that the story of his escapade would bealready known in moscow and that the ladies about his fatherwho werenever favorably disposed toward himwould have used it to turn thecount against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went tohis fathers part of the house entering the drawing room where theprincesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whomwere sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was theeldest who was readingthe one who had met anna mikhaylovna thetwo younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and theydiffered only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made hermuch prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leperthe eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at himwith frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expressionwhile the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful andlively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evokedby the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool down through thecanvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if tryingto make out the patternhow do you do cousin said pierre you dont recognizemei recognize you only too well too wellhow is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usualbut unabashedthe count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently youhave done your best to increase his mental sufferingscan i see the count pierre again askedhm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can seehim olga go and see whether uncles beef tea is readyit isalmost time she added giving pierre to understand that they werebusy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently hepierre was only busy causing him annoyanceolga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed andsaid then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can seehimand he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of thesister with the molenext day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the counts househe sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are goingto behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly thatis all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you mustnot see him at allsince then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time inhis rooms upstairswhen boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his roomstopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wallas if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagelyover his spectacles and then again resuming his walk mutteringindistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulatingengland is done for said he scowling and pointing his fingerat someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to therights of man is sentenced to but before pierrewho at thatmoment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have justeffected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and capturedlondoncould pronounce pitts sentence he saw a wellbuilt andhandsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he had leftmoscow when boris was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten himbut in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the handwith a friendly smiledo you remember me asked boris quietly with a pleasant smilei have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is notwellyes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing himanswered pierre trying to remember who this young man wasboris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not considerit necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the leastembarrassment looked pierre straight in the facecount rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after aconsiderable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortableah count rostov exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are hisson ilya only fancy i didnt know you at first do you rememberhow we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot its such anageyou are mistaken said boris deliberately with a bold andslightly sarcastic smile i am boris son of princess annamikhaylovna drubetskaya rostov the father is ilya and his son isnicholas i never knew any madame jacquotpierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or beesoh dear what am i thinking about ive mixed everything up onehas so many relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well nowwe know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expeditionthe english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across thechannel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuvedoesnt make a mess of thingsboris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read thepapers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuves namewe here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandalthan with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i knownothing about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busywith gossip he continued just now they are talking about you andyour fatherpierre smiled in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his companionssake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regretbut boris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight intopierres eyesmoscow has nothing else to do but gossip boris went oneverybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortunethough he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he willyes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horridpierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently saysomething disconcerting to himselfand it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but notchanging his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone istrying to get something out of the rich manso it does thought pierrebut i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you arequite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we arevery poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason thatyour father is rich i dont regard myself as a relation of his andneither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from himfor a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumpedup from the sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsyway and blushing far more than boris began to speak with a feelingof mingled shame and vexationwell this is strange do you suppose i who could think i knowvery wellbut boris again interrupted himi am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it youmust excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being putat ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make ita rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come todinner at the rostovsand boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty andextricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in itbecame quite pleasant againno but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderfulfellow what you have just said is good very good of course youdont know me we have not met for such a long time not since wewere children you might think that i i understand quite understandi could not have done it myself i should not have had the courage butits splendid i am very glad to have made your acquaintance itsqueer he added after a pause that you should have suspectedme he began to laugh well what of it i hope well get betteracquainted and he pressed boris hand do you know i have notonce been in to see the count he has not sent for me i am sorry forhim as a man but what can one doand so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across askedboris with a smilepierre saw that boris wished to change the subject and being of thesame mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of theboulogne expeditiona footman came in to summon boristhe princess was going pierre inorder to make boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinnerand warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectaclesinto boris eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up anddown the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe withhis imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasantintelligent and resolute young manas often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonelylife he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made uphis mind that they would be friendsprince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyesand her face was tearfulit is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what itmay i shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not beleft like this every moment is precious i cant think why his niecesput it off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare himadieu prince may god support youadieu ma bonne answered prince vasili turning away from heroh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son whenthey were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybodyi dont understand mammawhat is his attitude to pierreasked the sonthe will will show that my dear our fate also depends

thin dignifiedelderly face and she took the money from under the handkerchiefanna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to beready to embrace the countess at the appropriate momentthis is for boris from me for his outfitanna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countesswept too they wept because they were friends and because they werekindhearted and because theyfriends from childhoodhad to thinkabout such a base thing as money and because their youth was overbut those tears were pleasant to them bothchapter xviiicountess rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests wasalready seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen intohis study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes fromtime to time he went out to ask hasnt she come yet theywere expecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova known in society as leterrible dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but forcommon sense and frank plainness of speech marya dmitrievna was knownto the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and bothcities wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and toldgood stories about her while none the less all without exceptionrespected and feared herin the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talkedof the war that had been announced in a manifesto and about therecruiting none of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knewit had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two guests who weresmoking and talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his headfirst to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evidentpleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom heegged on against each otherone of them was a sallow cleanshaven civilian with a thin and wrinkledface already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionableyoung man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home andhaving stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling thesmoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelorshinshin a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongueas they said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending tohis companion the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guardsirreproachably washed brushed and buttoned held his pipe in themiddle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke lettingit escape from his handsome mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg anofficer in the semenov regiment with whom boris was to travel to jointhe army and about whom natasha had teased her elder sister veraspeaking of berg as her intended the count sat between them andlistened attentively his favorite occupation when not playing boston acard game he was very fond of was that of listener especially when hesucceeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one anotherwell then old chap mon tres honorable alphonse karlovichsaid shinshin laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russianexpressions with the choicest french phraseswhich was a peculiarityof his speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur letat you want to make something out of your company you expect to make an income out of the governmentno peter nikolaevich i only want to show that in the cavalrythe advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my ownposition now peter nikolaevichberg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision hisconversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calmand silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearingon himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all putout of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but assoon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talkcircumstantially and with evident satisfactionconsider my position peter nikolaevich were i in the cavalry ishould get not more than two hundred rubles every four months evenwith the rank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred andthirty said he looking at shinshin and the count with a joyfulpleasant smile as if it were obvious to him that his success mustalways be the chief desire of everyone elsebesides that peter nikolaevich by exchanging into the guardsi shall be in a more prominent position continued berg andvacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards then just thinkwhat can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage toput a little aside and to send something to my father he went onemitting a smoke ringla balance y est a german knows how to skin a flint as theproverb says remarked shinshin moving his pipe to the other sideof his mouth and winking at the count so that squares mattersthe count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshinwas talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifferencecontinued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had alreadygained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartimethe company commander might get killed and he as senior in the companymight easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone inthe regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidentlyenjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that otherstoo might have their own interests but all he said was so prettilysedate and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious thathe disarmed his hearerswell my boy youll get along wherever you gofoot orhorsethat ill warrant said shinshin patting him on theshoulder and taking his feet off the sofaberg smiled joyously the count followed by his guests went into thedrawing roomit was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guestsexpecting the summons to zakuska avoid engaging in any longconversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in orderto show that they are not at all impatient for their food the host andhostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one anotherand the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they arewaiting forsome important relation who has not yet arrived or a dishthat is not yet ready hors doeuvrespierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in themiddle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come acrossblocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talkbut he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if insearch of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables hewas in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most ofthe guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosityat this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modestfellow could have played such a prank on a policemanyou have only lately arrived the countess asked himoui madame replied he looking around himyou have not yet seen my husbandnon madame he smiled quite inappropriatelyyou have been in paris recently i believe i suppose its veryinterestingvery interestingthe countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna the latterunderstood that she was being asked to entertain this young man andsitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but heanswered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the otherguests were all conversing with one another the razumovskis itwas charming you are very kind countess apraksina was heardon all sides the countess rose and went into the ballroommarya dmitrievna came her voice from thereherself came the answer in a rough voice and marya dmitrievnaentered the roomall the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the veryoldest rose marya dmitrievna paused at the door tall and stoutholding high her fiftyyearold head with its gray curls she stoodsurveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as ifrolling them up marya dmitrievna always spoke in russianhealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to herchildren she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned allothers well you old sinner she went on turning to the countwho was kissing her hand youre feeling dull in moscow i daresaynowhere to hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man justsee how these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girlsyou must look for husbands for them whether you like it or notwell said she hows my cossack marya dmitrievnaalways called natasha a cossack and she stroked the childs arm asshe came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand i know shes a scampof a girl but i like hershe took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule andhaving given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with the pleasureof her saintsday fete turned away at once and addressed herself topierreeh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft hightone of voice come here my friend and she ominously tuckedup her sleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in achildlike way through his spectaclescome

this was clearly only a preludea fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbedand he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shamesir for shame it would be better if you went to the warshe turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keepfrom laughingwell i suppose it is time we were at table said maryadmitrievnathe count went in first with marya dmitrievna the countess followedon the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them becausenicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikhaylovnawith shinshin berg gave his arm to vera the smiling julie karaginawent in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling thewhole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governessesfollowed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped theband struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in theirplaces then the strains of the counts household band were replacedby the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and thesoft steps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess withmarya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left theother lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the countwith the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other malevisitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat thegrownup young people vera beside berg and pierre beside boris andon the other side the children tutors and governesses from behindthe crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at hiswife and her tall cap with its lightblue ribbons and busily filledhis neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turnwithout omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances frombehind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemedby their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at theladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at themens end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of thecolonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank somuch that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests bergwith tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly buta heavenly feeling boris was telling his new friend pierre who theguests were and exchanging glances with natasha who was sittingopposite pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate agreat deal of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties andwent on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the winesthese latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in anapkin from behind the next mans shoulders and whispered drymadeira hungarian or rhine wine as the case mightbe of the four crystal glasses engraved with the counts monogramthat stood before his plate pierre held out one at random and drankwith enjoyment gazing with everincreasing amiability at the otherguests natasha who sat opposite was looking at boris as girls ofthirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed forthe first time sometimes that same look fell on pierre and that funnylively little girls look made him inclined to laugh without knowingwhynicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside julie karagina towhom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile sonya worea company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turnedpale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholasand julie were saying to one another the governess kept looking rounduneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon thechildren the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes winesand kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinnerto his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butlerwith a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying toappear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified becauseno one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or fromgreediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire forknowledgechapter xixat the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more animatedthe colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appearedin petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that daybeen forwarded by courier to the commander in chiefand why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarkedshinshin he has stopped austrias cackle and i fear it will beour turn nextthe colonel was a

the wish which constitutes the emperors sole and absoluteaimto establish peace in europe on firm foundationshas now decidedhim to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new conditionfor the attainment of that purposezat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler ofwine with dignity and looking to the count for approvalconnaissezvous le proverbe jerome jerome do not roam butturn spindles at home said shinshin puckering his brows andsmiling cela nous convient a merveille suvorov nowhe knewwhat he was about yet they beat him a plate couture and whereare we to find suvorovs now

he endedagain turning to the count zat is how ve old hussars look at it andzeres an end of it and how do you a young man and a young hussarhow do you judge of it he added addressing nicholas who when heheard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner witheyes and ears intent on the coloneli am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turninghis plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decisionand desperation as though he were at that moment facing some greatdanger i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer heconcluded consciousas were othersafter the words were utteredthat his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion andwere therefore awkwardwhat you said just now was splendid said his partner juliesonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them anddown to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speakingpierre listened to the colonels speech and nodded approvinglythats fine said hethe young mans a real hussar shouted the colonel againthumping the tablewhat are you making such a noise about over there maryadmitrievnas deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of thetable what are

ice before the ices champagne was served round the bandagain struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leavingtheir seats went up to congratulate the countess and reachedacross the table to clink glasses with the count with the children andwith one another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped andin the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces theguests returned to the drawing room and to the counts studychapter xxthe card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and thecounts visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing roomssome in the sitting room some in the librarythe count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty fromdropping into his usual afterdinner nap and laughed at everythingthe young people at the countess instigation gathered round theclavichord and harp julie by general request played first after shehad played a little air with variations on the harp she joined theother young ladies in begging natasha and nicholas who were noted fortheir musical talent to sing something natasha who was treated asthough she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at thesame time felt shywhat shall we sing she saidthe brook suggested nicholaswell then lets be quick boris come here said natashabut where is sonyashe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran tolook for herrunning into sonyas room and not finding her there natasha ran tothe nursery but sonya was not there either natasha concluded thatshe must be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage wasthe place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostovhousehold and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on nursesdirty feather bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pinkdress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbingso convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook natashasface which had been so radiantly happy all that saints day suddenlychanged her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed down her broadneck and the corners of her mouth droopedsonya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo andnatashas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and shebegan to wail like a baby without knowing why except that sonya wascrying sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not andhid her face still deeper in the bed natasha wept sitting on thebluestriped feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sonyasat up and began wiping her eyes and explainingnicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers havecome he told me himself but

am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrificeeverything only i have nothingsonya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and inthe feather bed natasha began consoling her but

farewell to the celebrated grandee ofcatherines court count bezukhovthe magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood uprespectfully when the military governor having stayed about half anhour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging theirbows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixedon him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family princevasili who had grown thinner and paler during the last few daysescorted him to the door repeating something to him several times inlow toneswhen the military governor had gone prince vasili sat down all aloneon a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the otherleaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand aftersitting so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightenedeyes went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leadingto the back of the house to the room of the eldest princessthose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervouswhispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mansroom grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy athis door which creaked slightly when openedthe limits of human life are fixed and may not beoerpassed said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seatbeside him and was listening naively to his wordsi wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked thelady adding the priests clerical title as if she had no opinion ofher own on the subjectah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passinghis hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across hisbald headwho was that the military governor himself was being asked atthe other side of the room how younglooking he isyes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizesanyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unctioni knew someone who received that sacrament seven timesthe second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes redfrom

beforehis nosetonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved awaywith a decorous smile of selfsatisfaction at being able clearly tounderstand and state the patients conditionmeanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess roomin this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning beforethe icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastillesthe room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnotscupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed wasjust visible behind a screen a small dog began to barkah is it you cousinshe rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooththat it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered withvarnishhas anything happened she asked i am so terrifiedno there is no change i only came to have a talk about businesscatiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chairshe had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say heremarked well sit down lets have a talk catherinei thought perhaps something had happened she said with herunchanging stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite theprince she prepared to listeni wished to get a nap mon cousin but i cantwell my dear said prince vasili taking her hand and bending itdownwards as was his habitit was plain that this well referred to much that they bothunderstood without namingthe princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for herlegs looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in herprominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the iconswith a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrowand devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long princevasili understood it as an expression of wearinessand i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as wornout as a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche avery serious talkprince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervouslynow on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasantexpression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyestoo seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at thenext glanced round in alarmthe princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bonyhands looked attentively into prince vasilis eyes evidentlyresolved not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait tillmorningwell you see my dear princess and cousin catherine semenovnacontinued prince vasili returning to his theme apparently notwithout an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must thinkof everything one must think of the future of all of you i love youall like children of my own as you knowthe princess continued to look at him without moving and with the samedull expressionand then of course my family has also to be considered princevasili went on testily pushing away a little table without looking ather you know catiche that weyou three sisters mamontov andmy wifeare the counts only direct heirs i know i know how hardit is for you to talk or think of such matters it is no easier forme but my dear i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared foranything do you know i have sent for pierre the count pointing tohis portrait definitely demanded that he should be calledprince vasili looked questioningly at the princess but could not makeout whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she wassimply looking at himthere is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin shereplied and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allowhis noble soul peacefully to leave thisyes yes of course interrupted prince vasili impatientlyrubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the littletable that he had pushed away but in short the fact is youknow yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he leftall his property not to us his direct heirs but to pierrehe has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess but hecannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimatebut my dear said prince vasili suddenly clutching the littletable and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what ifa letter has been written to the emperor in which the count asks forpierres legitimation do you understand that in consideration of thecounts services his request would be grantedthe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about thesubject under discussion than those they are talking withi can tell you more continued prince vasili seizing her handthat letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knewof it the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not thenas soon as all is over and prince vasili sighed to intimate what hemeant by the words all is over and the counts papers are openedthe will and letter will be delivered to the emperor and the petitionwill certainly be granted pierre will get everything as the legitimatesonand our share asked the princess smiling ironically as ifanything might happen only not thatbut my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be thelegal heir to everything and you wont get anything you must knowmy dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they havebeen destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked youought to know where they are and must find them becausewhat next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and notchanging the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you think weare all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inheritun batard she added as if supposing that this translation of theword would effectively prove to prince vasili the invalidity of hiscontention a bastardwell really catiche cant you understand you are sointelligent how is it you dont see that if the count has written aletter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate itfollows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezukhovand will then inherit everything under the will and if the will andletter are not destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolationof having been dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit thats certain and all that follows therefromi know the will was made but i also know that it is invalidand you mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said theprincess with the expression women assume when they suppose they aresaying something witty and stingingmy dear princess catherine semenovna began prince vasiliimpatiently i came here not to wrangle with you but to talk aboutyour interests as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and itell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and thewill in pierres favor are among the counts papers then my deargirl you and your sisters are not heiresses if you dont believe methen believe an expert i have just been talking to dmitri onufrichthe family solicitor and he says the sameat this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideasher thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voicewhen she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herselfevidently did not expectthat would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anythingand i dont nowshe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dressand this is gratitudethis is recognition for those who havesacrificed everything for his sake she cried its splendidfine i dont want anything princeyes but you are not the only one there are your sistersreplied prince vasilibut the princess did not listen to himyes i knew it long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expectnothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitudetheblackest ingratitudein this housedo you or do you not know where that will is insisted princevasili his cheeks twitching more than everyes i was a fool i still believed in people loved them andsacrificed myself but only the base the vile succeed i know who hasbeen intriguingthe princess wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand shehad the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human raceshe gave her companion an angry glancethere is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it wasall done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwardsforgotten our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease hislast moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to lethim die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those whowho sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess whowould again have risen had not the prince still held her fast thoughhe never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sighi shall always remember that in this world one must expect no rewardthat in this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world onehas to be cunning and cruelnow come come be reasonable i know your excellent heartno i have a wicked hearti know your heart repeated the prince i value your friendshipand wish you to have as good an opinion of me dont upset yourselfand let us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be itbut an hour tell me all you know about the will and above all whereit is you must know we will take it at once and show it to thecount he has no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy ityou understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to

the princess ignoring his question now i know yes if i havea sin a great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shriekedthe princess now quite changed and what does she come wormingherself in here for but i will give her a piece of my mind the timewill comechapter xxiiwhile these conversations were going on in the reception room and theprincess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent forand anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him wasdriving into the court of count bezukhovs house as the wheelsrolled softly over the straw beneath the windows anna mikhaylovnahaving turned with words of comfort to her companion realized thathe was asleep in his corner and woke him up rousing himself pierrefollowed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then beganto think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him henoticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the backdoor while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men wholooked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in theshadow of the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several othermen of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sidesbut neither anna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman whocould not help seeing these people took any notice of them it seemsto be all right pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovnashe hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling topierre who was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why itwas necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he hadto go by the back stairs yet judging by anna mikhaylovnas airof assurance and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutelynecessary halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over bysome men who carrying pails came running downstairs their bootsclattering these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and annamikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing themthereis this the way to the princesses apartments asked annamikhaylovna of one of themyes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything werenow permissible the door to the left maamperhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reachedthe landing id better go to my own roomanna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come upah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done hersons when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer noless than you do but be a manbut really hadnt i better go away he asked looking kindly ather over his spectaclesah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done youthink that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death shesighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself tome pierre i shall not forget your interestspierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this hadto be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who wasalready opening a doorthis door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of theprincesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never beenin this part of the house and did not even know of the existence ofthese rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying pastwith a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet askedabout the princess health and then led pierre along a stone passagethe first door on the left led into the princesses apartments themaid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everythingin the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and annamikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room whereprince vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close togethertalking seeing them pass prince vasili drew back with obviousimpatience while the princess jumped up and with a gesture ofdesperation slammed the door with all her mightthis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted onprince vasilis face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierrestopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide annamikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed asif to say that this was no more than she had expectedbe a man my friend i will look after your interests said she inreply to his look and went still faster along the passagepierre could not make out what it was all about and still less whatwatching over his interests meant but he decided that all thesethings had to be from the passage they went into a large dimlylit room adjoining the counts reception room it was one of thosesumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the frontapproach but even in this room there now stood an empty bath and waterhad been spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censerand by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them theywent into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italianwindows opening into the conservatory with its large bust and fulllength portrait of catherine the great the same people were stillsitting here in almost the same positions as before whispering to oneanother all became silent and turned to look at the pale tearworn annamikhaylovna as she entered and at the big stout figure of pierre whohanging his head meekly followed heranna mikhaylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisivemoment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she nowkeeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly thanthat afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person thedying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapidglance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessorthere she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yetseeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessingfirst of one and then of another priestgod be thanked that you are in time said she to one of thepriests all we relatives have been in such anxiety this youngman is the counts son she added more softly what a terriblemomenthaving said this she went up to the doctordear doctor said she this young man is the counts son isthere any hopethe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged hisshoulders anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised hershoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved awayfrom the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful andtenderly sad voice she saidtrust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sitand wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone waswatching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind itpierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly movedtoward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikhaylovna haddisappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to himwith something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that theywhispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kindof awe and even servility a deference such as he had never beforereceived was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking tothe priests rose and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked upand returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfullysilent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierrewished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also topick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were noteven in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do andthat tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awfulrite which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore boundto accept their services he took the glove in silence from theaidedecamp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge handssymmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statueand decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that inorder not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on hisown ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will ofthose who were guiding himnot two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erectmajestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with threestars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morninghis eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticedpierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to doand drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmlyfixed oncourage courage my friend he has asked to see you that iswell and he turned to gobut pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitatednot knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man thecount yet ashamed to call him fatherhe had another stroke about half an hour ago courage myfriendpierres mind was in such a confused state that the word strokesuggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasiliin perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack ofillness prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and wentthrough the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and hiswhole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him andthe priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the doorthrough that door was heard a noise of things being moved about andat last anna mikhaylovna still with the same expression pale butresolute in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightlyon the arm saidthe divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to beadministered comepierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticedthat the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants allfollowed him in as if there were now no further need for permission toenter that roomchapter xxiiipierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch itswalls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind thecolumns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side andon the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminatedwith red light like a russian church during evening service underthe gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chairon snowywhite smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierresawcovered to the waist by a bright green quiltthe familiarmajestic figure of his father count bezukhov with that gray mane ofhair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deepcharacteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he layjust under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt into theright hand which was lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrustbetween forefinger and thumb and an old servant bending over frombehind the chair held it in position by the chair stood the prieststheir long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestmentswith lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting theservice a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holdinghandkerchiefs to their eyes and just in front of them their eldestsister catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed onthe icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer forherself should she glance round anna mikhaylovna with a meeksorrowful and allforgiving expression on her face stood by the doornear the strange lady prince vasili in front of the door near theinvalid chair a wax taper in his left hand was leaning his left arm onthe carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purposeand was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes upwardeach time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of pietyand resignation to the will of god if you do not understand thesesentiments he seemed to be saying so much the worse for youbehind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservantsthe men and women had separated as in church all were silently crossingthemselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chantingof deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling offeet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna withan air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what shewas about went across the room to where pierre was standing and gavehim a taper he lit it and distracted by observing those around himbegan crossing himself with the hand that held the tapersophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the molewatched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remainedwith it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre sheagain began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at himwithout laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out oftemptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midstof the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whisperedto one another and the old servant who was holding the counts handgot up and said something to the ladies anna mikhaylovna steppedforward and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain frombehind her back the french doctor held no taper he was leaningagainst one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that hea foreigner in spite of all differences of faith understood the fullimportance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it henow approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigorof life with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt thehand that was free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflecteda moment the sick man was given something to drink there was astir around him then the people resumed their places and the servicecontinued during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasilileft the chair on which he had been leaning andwith an airwhich intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did notunderstand him it was so much the worse for themdid not go up to thedying man but passed by him joined the eldest princess and movedwith her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with itssilken hangings on leaving the bed both prince vasili and the princesspassed out by a back door but returned to their places one after theother before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attentionto this occurrence than to the rest of what went on having made up hismind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening wasin some way essentialthe chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest washeard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received thesacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before aroundhim everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among whichanna mikhaylovnas was the most distinctpierre heard her saycertainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will beimpossiblethe sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servantsthat pierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its graymanewhich though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sightof for a single moment during the whole service he judged by thecautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair thatthey had lifted the dying man and were moving himcatch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of theservants say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneathhere exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of thebearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if theweight they were carrying were too much for themas the bearers among whom was anna mikhaylovna passed the young manhe caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dyingmans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised bythose who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curlyleonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbonesits handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression wasnot disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierreremembered it three months before when the count had sent him topetersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the unevenmovements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself uponnothingafter a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who hadcarried the sick man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched pierreshand and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which thesick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremonyjust completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows hishands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palmsdownward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him butwith a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortalman either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyesthey must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitatednot knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide annamikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sickmans hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss pierrecarefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed hersuggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand neitherthe hand nor a single muscle of the counts face stirred once morepierre looked questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was todo next anna mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stoodbeside the bed pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he weredoing right anna mikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fellinto the naively symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidentlydistressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doinghis utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the count whostill gazed at the spot where pierres face had been before he satdown anna mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness ofthe pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between thefather and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre seemed anhour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the counts face beganto twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to oneside only now did pierre realize how near death his father was andfrom that distorted mouth issued an indistinct hoarse sound annamikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick mans eyes trying toguess what he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to some drinkthen named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper then pointed to thequilt the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience he made aneffort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of thebedwants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got upto turn the counts heavy body toward the wallpierre rose to help himwhile the count was being turned over one of his arms fell backhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether henoticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless armor whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at anyrate he glanced at the refractory arm at pierres terrorstrickenface and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smileappeared quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deridehis own helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpectedquivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed hiseyes the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wallhe sighedhe is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of theprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us gopierre went outchapter xxivthere was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and theeldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine thegreat and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companionthey became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hidesomething as she whisperedi cant bear the sight of that womancatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said princevasili to anna mikhaylovna go and take something my poor annamikhaylovna or you will not hold outto pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeezebelow the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the smalldrawing roomthere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cupof this delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air ofrestrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinesehandleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laidin the small circular room around the table all who were at countbezukhovs house that night had gathered to fortify themselvespierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrorsand little tables during balls given at the house pierre who did notknow how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladieswho as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds andpearls on their bare shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantlylighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times nowthis same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one small table teathings and supper dishes stood in disorder and in the middle of thenight a motley throng of people sat there not merrymaking but somberlywhispering and betraying by every word and movement that they noneof them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in thebedroom pierre did not eat anything though he would very much haveliked to he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she wasagain going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left princevasili and the eldest princess pierre concluded that this also wasessential and after a short interval followed her anna mikhaylovnawas standing beside the princess and they were both speaking in excitedwhisperspermit me princess to know what is necessary and what is notnecessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in thesame state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her roombut my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna blandly butimpressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the otherfrom passing wont this be too much for poor uncle at a momentwhen he needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul isalready preparedprince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitudewith one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were soflabby that they looked heavier below were twitching violently buthe wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies weresayingcome my dear anna mikhaylovna let catiche do as she pleases youknow how fond the count is of heri dont even know what is in this paper said the younger ofthe two ladies addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaidportfolio she held in her hand all i know is that his real

seizingthe portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easilydear princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vousen conjurethe princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for theportfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that ifthe princess did speak her words would not be flattering to annamikhaylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost noneof its honeyed firmness and softnesspierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in afamily consultation is it not so princewhy dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess soloud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled whydo you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself tointerfere making a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans roomintriguer she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at theportfoliobut anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on theportfolio and changed her gripprince vasili rose oh said he with reproach and surprisethis is absurd come let go i tell youthe princess let goand you toobut anna mikhaylovna did not obey himlet go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will goand ask him i does that satisfy youbut prince said anna mikhaylovna after such a solemnsacrament allow him a moments peace here pierre tell them youropinion said she turning to the young man who having come quiteclose was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princesswhich had lost all dignity and at the twitching cheeks of princevasiliremember that you will answer for the consequences said princevasili severely you dont know what you are doingvile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at annamikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from herprince vasili bent his head and spread out his handsat this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so longand which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and bangedagainst the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed outwringing her handswhat are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and youleave me alone with himher sister dropped the portfolio anna mikhaylovna stooping quicklycaught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldestprincess and prince vasili recovering themselves followed her a fewminutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face againbiting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed anirrepressible hatredyes now you may be glad said she this is what you havebeen waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in herhandkerchief and rushed from the roomprince vasili came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre wassitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierrenoticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in anagueah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there wasin his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in itbefore how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i amnear sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death isawful and he burst into tearsanna mikhaylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quietstepspierre she saidpierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on hisforehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she saidhe is no morepierre looked at her over his spectaclescome i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief astearsshe led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one couldsee his face anna mikhaylovna left

mikhaylovna after her talk with pierre annamikhaylovna returned to the rostovs and went to bed on waking inthe morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the detailsof count bezukhovs death she said the count had died as she wouldherself wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying asto the last meeting between father and son it was so touching that shecould not think of it without tears and did not know which had behavedbetter during those awful momentsthe father who so rememberedeverything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words tothe son or pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was hewith grief though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden hisdying father it is painful but it does one good it uplifts thesoul to

virtuesactivity and intelligence hehimself undertook his daughters education and to develop these twocardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometrytill she was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time wasoccupied he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs solvingproblems in higher mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe workingin the garden or superintending the building that was always going onat his estate as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activityregularity in his household was carried to the highest point ofexactitude he always came to table under precisely the same conditionsand not only at the same hour but at the same minute with those abouthim from his daughter to his serfs the prince was sharp and invariablyexacting so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fearand respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused although he wasin retirement and had now no influence in political affairs every highofficial appointed to the province in which the princes estate layconsidered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamberjust as the architect gardener or princess mary did till the princeappeared punctually to the appointed hour everyone sitting in thisantechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear whenthe enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rathersmall old man with powdered wig small withered hands and bushy grayeyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewdyouthfully glittering eyeson the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive princessmary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for themorning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating asilent prayer every morning she came in like that and every morningprayed that the daily interview might pass off wellan old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rosequietly and said in a whisper please walk inthrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princess timidlyopened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused at theentrance the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing roundcontinued his workthe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant usethe large table covered with books and plans the tall glassfrontedbookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing whilestanding up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe withtools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall indicatedcontinuous varied and orderly activity the motion of the small footshod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressureof the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed thetenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age after a few more turnsof the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chiseldropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approachingthe table summoned his daughter he never gave his children a blessingso he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regardingher tenderly and attentively said severelyquite well all right

paragraph to another with his hard nailthe princess bent over the exercise book on the tablewait a bit heres a letter for you said the old man suddenlytaking a letter addressed in a womans hand from a

prince abruptly pushingthe letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward himthe exercise book containing geometrical figureswell madam he began stooping over the book close to hisdaughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she satso that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent ofold age and tobacco which she had known so long now madam thesetriangles are equal please note that the angle abcthe princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glitteringclose to her the red patches on her face came and went and it wasplain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that herfear would prevent her understanding any of her fathers furtherexplanations however clear they might be whether it was theteachers fault or the pupils this same thing happened every daythe princess eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hearanything but was only conscious of her stern fathers withered faceclose to her of his breath and the smell of him and could think onlyof how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem inpeace the old man was beside himself moved the chair on which he wassitting noisily backward and forward made efforts to control himselfand not become vehement but almost always did become vehement scoldedand sometimes flung the exercise book awaythe princess gave a wrong answerwell now isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the bookaside and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up anddown lightly touched his daughters hair and sat down againhe drew up his chair and continued to explainthis wont do princess it wont do said he when princessmary having taken and closed the exercise book with the next dayslesson was about to leave mathematics are most important madami dont want to have you like our silly ladies get used to it andyoull like it and he patted her cheek it will drive all thenonsense out of your headshe turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncutbook from the high deskhere is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise hassent you religious i dont interfere with anyones belief ihave looked at it take it well now go gohe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after herprincess mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression thatrarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer shesat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits andwhich was littered with books and papers the princess was as untidy asher father was tidy she put down the geometry book and eagerly brokethe seal of her letter it was from her most intimate friend fromchildhood that same julie karagina who had been at the rostovsnameday partyjulie wrote in frenchdear and precious friend how terrible and frightful a thing isseparation though i tell myself that half my life and half my happinessare wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating usour hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels againstfate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannotovercome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever sincewe parted why are we not together as we were last summer in your bigstudy on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot i now asthree months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentlecalm and penetrating a look i loved so well and seem to see before meas i writehaving read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirrorwhich stood on her right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure andthin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessnessat her reflection in the glass she flatters me thought theprincess turning away and continuing to read but julie did not flatterher friend the princess eyeslarge deep and luminous it seemedas if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm lightwereso beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her facethey gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty but theprincess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyesthe lookthey had when she was not thinking of herself as with everyone herface assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in aglass she went on readingall moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is alreadyabroad the other is with the guards who are starting on their marchto the frontier our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thoughtintends to expose his precious person to the chances of war god grantthat the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe maybe overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty in hisgoodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my brothers thiswar has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart i meanyoung nicholas rostov who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remaininactive and has left the university to join the army i will confess toyou dear mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure forthe army was a great grief to me this young man of whom i spoke to youlast summer is so nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness whichone seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularlyhe is so frank and has so much heart he is so pure and poetic thatmy relations with him transient as they were have been one of thesweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so muchsomeday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said thenthat is still too fresh ah dear friend you are happy not to knowthese poignant joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter aregenerally the stronger i know very well that count nicholas is tooyoung ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendshipthis poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed but enough ofthis the chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death ofold count bezukhov and his inheritance fancy the three princesseshave received very little prince vasili nothing and it is monsieurpierre who has inherited all the property and has besides beenrecognized as legitimate so that he is now count bezukhov andpossessor of the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that princevasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that hereturned to petersburg quite crestfalleni confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills andinheritance but i do know that since this young man whom we all usedto know as plain monsieur pierre has become count bezukhov and theowner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused towatch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened bymarriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves towardhim though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sortof fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselvesby finding husbands for me most of whom i dont even know thematchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countessbezukhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the posta propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universalauntie anna mikhaylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy ofa plan of marriage for you it is neither more nor less than with princevasilis son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him tosomeone rich and distinguee and it is on you that his relationschoice has fallen i dont know what you will think of it buti consider it my duty to let you know of it he is said to be veryhandsome and a terrible scapegrace that is all i have been able to findout about himbut enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper andmamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apraksins read themystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here thoughthere are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp itis an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu givemy respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoisellebourienne i embrace you as i love youjulieps let me have news of your brother and his charming little wifethe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminouseyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenlyrose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet ofpaper and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrotealso in frenchdear and precious friend your letter of the th has given me greatdelight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of whichyou say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effecton you you complain of our separation what then should i say if idared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ah ifwe had not religion to console us life would be very sad why do yousuppose that i should look severely on your affection for that youngman on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand suchfeelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve ofthem neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christianlove love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthiersweeter and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of ayoung man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourselfthe news of count bezukhovs death reached us before your letterand my father was much affected by it he says the count was the lastrepresentative but one of the great century and that it is his ownturn now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late aspossible god preserve us from that terrible misfortunei cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child he alwaysseemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality i valuemost in people as to his inheritance and the part played by princevasili it is very sad for both ah my dear friend our divinesaviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through theeye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god areterribly true i pity prince vasili but am still more sorry for pierreso young and burdened with such richesto what temptations he will beexposed if i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to bepoorer than the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for thevolume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet sinceyou tell me that among some good things it contains others which ourweak human understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless tospend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bearno fruit i never could understand the fondness some people have forconfusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awakentheir doubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent forexaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather readthe epistles and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteriesthey contain for how can we miserable sinners that we are know theterrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this fleshwhich forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal let usrather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which ourdivine saviour has left for our guidance here below let us try toconform to them and follow them and let us be persuaded that the lesswe let our feeble human minds roam the better we shall please god whorejects all knowledge that does not come from him and the less we seekto fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner willhe vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spiritmy father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that hehas received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasili inregard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear sweetfriend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we mustconform however painful it may be to me should the almighty laythe duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them asfaithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining my feelingstoward him whom he may give me for husbandi have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrivalat bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief onehowever for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy warinto which we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where youareat the heart of affairs and of the worldis the talk all ofwar even here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolkconsider characteristic of the countryrumors of war are heardand painfully felt my father talks of nothing but marches andcountermarches things of which i understand nothing and the daybefore yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed aheartrending scene it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from ourpeople and starting to join the army you should have seen the state ofthe mothers wives and children of the men who were going and shouldhave heard the sobs it seems as though mankind has forgotten thelaws of its divine saviour who preached love and forgiveness ofinjuriesand that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killingone anotheradieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holymother keep you in their holy and allpowerful caremaryah you are sending off a letter princess i have already dispatchedmine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoisellebourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rsshe brought into princess marys strenuous mournful and

humor my father is in i do not allow myself to judgehim and would not have others do sothe princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minuteslate in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sittingroom with a look of alarm between twelve and two oclock as theday was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played theclavichordchapter xxvithe grayhaired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring ofthe prince who was in his large study from the far side of the housethrough the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagestwentytimes repeatedof a sonata by dussekjust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to theporch prince andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife toalight and let her pass into the house before

any other unusualevent must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day princeandrew apparently knew this as well as tikhon he looked at his watchas if to ascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since hewas at home last and having assured himself that they had not heturned to his wifehe will get up in twenty minutes let us go across to marysroom he saidthe little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyesand her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just asmerrily and prettily as everwhy this is a palace she said to her husband looking aroundwith the expression with which people compliment their host at a balllets come quick quick and with a glance round she smiled attikhon at her husband and at the footman who accompanied themis that mary practicing lets go quietly and take her bysurpriseprince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expressionyouve grown older tikhon he said in passing to the old manwho kissed his handbefore they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichordcame the pretty fairhaired frenchwoman mademoiselle bouriennerushed out apparently beside herself with delightah what joy for the princess exclaimed she at last i mustlet her knowno no please not you are mademoiselle bourienne saidthe little princess kissing her i know you already through mysisterinlaws friendship for you she was not expecting usthey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the soundof the oftrepeated passage of the sonata prince andrew stopped andmade a grimace as if expecting something unpleasantthe little princess entered the room the passage broke off in themiddle a cry was heard then princess marys heavy tread and thesound of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses whohad only met once before for a short time at his wedding were ineach others arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place theyhappened to touch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing herhand to her heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready tocry or to laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned aslovers of music do when they hear a false note the two women let goof one another and then as if afraid of being too late seized eachothers hands kissing them and pulling them away and again begankissing each other on the face and then to prince andrews surpriseboth began to cry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also began tocry prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two womenit seemed quite natural that they should cry and apparently it neverentered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meetingah my dear ah mary they suddenly exclaimed and thenlaughed i dreamed last nightyou were not expectingus ah mary

eyes very beautiful at that momentrested on prince andrews facethe little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lipcontinually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessaryand drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile ofglittering teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an accident they hadhad on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in hercondition and immediately after that informed them that she had leftall her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would haveto dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kittyodyntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for marya real one but that they would talk of that later princess mary wasstill looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were fullof love and sadness it was plain that she was following a train ofthought independent of her sisterinlaws words in the midst of adescription of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brotherso you are really going to the war andrew she said sighinglise sighed tooyes and even tomorrow replied her brotherhe is leaving me here god knows why when he might have hadpromotionprincess

elapsed and the time had come for the oldprince to get up tikhon came to call the young prince to his fatherthe old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of hissons arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments whilehe dressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in oldfashionedstyle wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when prince andrewentered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look andmanner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with whichhe talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leathercoveredchair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tikhonah heres the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said theold man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which tikhonwas holding fast to plait

twentythousand austrians with a hundred thousand russians were to operate initaly and on the rhine how fifty thousand russians and as many englishwere to land at naples and how a total force of five

interrupted sayingand will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfullysaid thats bad go on go onthe third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing hisdescription the old man

mademoisellebourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who bya strange caprice of his employers was admitted to table though theposition of that insignificant individual was such as could certainlynot have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally keptvery strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even importantgovernment officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michaelivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on hischecked handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equalsand had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovichwas not a whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usuallyspoke to the taciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone elsein the dining room which like all the rooms in the house wasexceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmenonebehind each chairstood waiting for the prince to enter the headbutler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table makingsigns to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the doorby which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a largegilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princesbolkonski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly paintedportrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estateof a ruling prince in a crownan alleged descendant of rurik andancestor of the bolkonskis prince andrew looking again at thatgenealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks ata portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusinghow thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who hadcome up to himprincess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understandwhat he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her withreverence and was beyond questioneveryone has his achilles heel continued prince andrewfancy with his powerful mind indulging in such nonsenseprincess mary could not understand the boldness of her brotherscriticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heardcoming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as washis wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his mannerswith the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clockstruck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawingroom the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from undertheir thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested onthe little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters thesensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all aroundhim he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back ofher neckim glad glad to see you he said looking attentively intoher eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit downsit down sit down michael ivanovichhe indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw a footman movedthe chair for

as much as possible as much as possible hesaidthe little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she wassilent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father andshe began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances andshe became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetingsfrom various people and retelling the town gossipcountess apraksina poor thing has lost her husband and she hascried her eyes out she said growing more and more livelyas she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternlyand suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed adefinite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivanovichwell michael ivanovich our bonaparte will be having a bad timeof it prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has beentelling me what forces are being collected against him while you and inever thought much of himmichael ivanovich did not at all know when you and i had saidsuch things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted asa peg on which to hang the princes favorite topic he lookedinquiringly at the young prince wondering what would followhe is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing tothe architectand the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and thegenerals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced notonly that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know thea b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificantlittle frenchy successful only because there were no longer anypotemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convincedthat there were no political difficulties in europe and no real warbut only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playingpretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with hisfathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to himwith evident pleasurethe past always seems good said he but did not suvorovhimself fall into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not knowhow to escapewho told you that who cried the prince suvorov and hejerked away his plate which tikhon briskly caught suvorovconsider prince

bonaparte youmay laugh as much as you like but all the same bonaparte is a greatgeneralmichael ivanovich cried the old prince to the architect whobusy with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten didnti tell you buonaparte was a great tactician here he says the samethingto be sure your excellency replied the architectthe prince again laughed his frigid laughbuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has gotsplendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and onlyidlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybodyhas beaten the germans they beat no oneexcept one another he madehis reputation fighting themand the prince began explaining all the blunders which according tohim bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics hisson made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments werepresented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion helistened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how thisold man living alone in the country for so many years could know anddiscuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military andpolitical eventsyou think im an old man and dont understand the present stateof affairs concluded his father but it troubles me i dontsleep at night come now where has this great commander of yours shownhis skill he concludedthat would take too long to tell

bonapartistdieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and witha laugh still more so he quitted the tablethe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest ofthe dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at herfatherinlaw and now at princess mary when they left the table shetook her sisterinlaws arm and drew her into another roomwhat a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is whyi am afraid of himoh he is so kind answered princess marychapter xxviiiprince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not alteringhis routine retired as usual

the future prince andrews facelooked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he pacedbriskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before himand thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or washe sad at leaving his wifeperhaps both but evidently he did notwish to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage hehurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying thecover of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrableexpression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heardi hear you have given orders to

andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sittingdown on the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such adear merry child i have grown so fond of herprince andrew was silent but the

shouting in an angry voiceprince andrew sighed and made no replywell he said turning to his wifeand this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying nowgo through your performanceandrew already said the little princess turning pale andlooking with dismay at her husbandhe embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulderhe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her faceand carefully placed her in an easy chairadieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the handand kissing her and then he left the room with rapid stepsthe little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafingher temples princess mary supporting her sisterinlaw still lookedwith her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which princeandrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction fromthe study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old manangrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the studydoor opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the whitedressing gown looked outgone thats all right said he and looking angrily at theunconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammedthe doorbook two chapter iin october a russian army was occupying the villages and towns ofthe archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving fromrussia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening theinhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters ofthe commander in chief kutuzovon october one of the infantry regiments that had just reachedbraunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspectedby the commander in chief despite the unrussian appearance of thelocality and surroundingsfruit gardens stone fences tiled roofsand hills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitantswho gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians theregiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing foran inspection anywhere in the heart of russiaon the evening of the last days march an order had been received thatthe commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march thoughthe words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander andthe question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order ornot it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commandersto present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it isalways better to bow too low than not bow low enough so thesoldiers after a twentymile march were kept mending and cleaning allnight long without closing their eyes while the adjutants andcompany commanders calculated and reckoned and by morning theregimentinstead of the straggling disorderly crowd it had been onits last march the day beforepresented a wellordered array of twothousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty had every buttonand every strap in place and shone with cleanliness and not onlyexternally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chiefto look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a cleanshirt and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles awlsoap and all as the soldiers say there was only one circumstanceconcerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of thesoldiers boots more than half the mens boots were in holes butthis defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander forin spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austriancommissariat and the regiment had marched some seven hundred milesthe commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout andthickset general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider fromchest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brandnew uniformshowing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epauletteswhich seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders hehad the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties ofhis life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulledhimself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commanderadmired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind wasengrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides militarymatters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of histhoughtswell michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of thebattalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain thatthey both felt happy we had our hands full last night however ithink the regiment is not a bad one ehthe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughedit would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsinmeadowwhat asked the commanderat that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had beenposted two men appeared on horse back they were an aidedecampfollowed by a cossackthe aidedecamp was sent to confirm the order which had not beenclearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chiefwished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been onthe march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparationwhatevera member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the daybefore with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army ofthe archduke ferdinand and mack and kutuzov not considering thisjunction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his viewto show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troopsarrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regimentso the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commanderin chief would be though the aidedecamp did not know thesecircumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that themen should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that thecommander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this theregimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders andspread out his arms with a choleric gesturea fine mess weve made of it he remarkedthere now didnt i tell you michael mitrich that if it was saidon the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully tothe battalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutelyforward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed tocommand sergeants major how soon will he be here he askedthe aidedecamp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to thepersonage he was referring toin an hours time i should sayshall we have time to change clothesi dont know generalthe regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered thesoldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran offto their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoatswere not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had upto then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch andhum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwingup their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the strapsover their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves onwith upraised armsin half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become grayinstead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky stepsto the front of the regiment and examined it from a distancewhatever is this this he shouted and stood still commanderof the third companycommander of the third company wanted by the general commander tothe general third company to the commander the words passed alongthe lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officerwhen the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination ina cry of the general to the third company the missing officerappeared from behind his company and though he was a middleaged manand not in the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on histoes toward the general the captains face showed the uneasiness ofa schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spotsappeared on his nose the redness of which was evidently due tointemperance and his mouth twitched nervously the general looked thecaptain up and down as he came up panting slackening his pace as heapproachedyou will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is thisshouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointingat a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluishcloth which contrasted with the others what have you been afterthe commander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh illteach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade ehthe commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superiorpressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in thispressure lay his only hope of salvationwell why dont you speak whom have you got there

you and you what he added with renewed irritation ibeg you to dress your men decentlyand the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerkysteps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display ofanger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse forwrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at anotherbecause his line was not straight he reached the third companyhoow are you standing wheres your leg your leg shoutedthe commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there werestill five men between him and dolokhov with his

smiled slightly astreading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those twothousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander didnot existthe word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with ajingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence thefeeble voice of the commander in chief was heard the regiment roaredhealth to your ex len len lency and again all becamesilent at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved then heand the general in white accompanied by the suite walked between theranksfrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief anddevoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and fromthe way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forwardand hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way hedarted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chiefit was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with evengreater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness andassiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others thathad reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition therewere only sick and stragglers everything was in good order exceptthe bootskutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a fewfriendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimesalso to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook hishead sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expressionwhich seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not helpnoticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commanderran forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of thecommander in chiefs regarding the regiment behind kutuzov at adistance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followedsome twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselvesand sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walkeda handsome adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was hiscomrade nesvitski a tall staff officer extremely stout with akindly smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardlykeep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walkedbeside him this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or achange in the expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimentalcommanders back and mimicked his every movement each time thecommander started and bent forward the hussar started and bent forwardin exactly the same manner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others tomake them look at the wagkutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which werestarting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching thethird company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected thisinvoluntarily came closer to himah timokhin said he recognizing the rednosed captain who hadbeen reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoatone would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himselfmore than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimentalcommander but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drewhimself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustainedit had the commander in chief continued to look at him and so kutuzovwho evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but goodquickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over hisscarred and puffy faceanother ismail comrade said he a brave officer are yousatisfied with him he asked the regimental commanderand the latterunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussarofficer as in a looking glassstarted moved forward and answeredhighly satisfied your excellencywe all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking awayfrom him he used to have a predilection for bacchusthe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and didnot answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the rednosedcaptain and his drawnin stomach and mimicked his expression and posewith such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutuzovturned round the officer evidently had complete control of his faceand while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assumea most serious deferential and innocent expressionthe third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently tryingto recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among thesuite and said in frenchyou told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov reduced to theranks in this regimentwhere is dolokhov asked kutuzovdolokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoatdid not wait to be called the shapely figure of the fairhairedsoldier with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks wentup to the commander in chief and presented armshave you a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frownthis is dolokhov said prince andrewah said kutuzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do yourduty the emperor is gracious and i shant forget you if you deservewellthe clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly asthey had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expressionto tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chiefso widely from a privateone thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firmringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my faultand prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russiakutuzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he hadturned from captain timokhin again flitted over his face he turnedaway with a grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said tohim and everything he could say had long been known to him that he wasweary of it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away andwent to the carriagethe regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointedquarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes andto rest after their hard marchesyou wont bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said theregimental commander overtaking the third company on its way to itsquarters and riding up to

saidtimokhin to the subaltern beside himin a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing theregimental commander was nicknamed king of heartsthe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected thesoldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could beheard on every sideand they said kutuzov was blind of one eyeand so he is quite blindno friend he is sharpereyed than you

here theyreall regular germanssingers to the front came the captains orderand from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front adrummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishinghis arm began a longdrawnout soldiers song commencing with thewords morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding onthen brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song hadbeen composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria theonly change being that the words father kamenski were replaced byfather kutuzovhaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his armsas if flinging something to the ground the drummera lean handsomesoldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up hiseyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on himhe raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but preciousobject above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenlyflung it down and beganoh my bower oh my boweroh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanetplayer in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the frontand walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders andflourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiersswinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with longsteps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springsand the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kutuzov and his suite werereturning to the town the commander in chief made a sign that themen should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showedpleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancingsoldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second filefrom the right flank beside which the carriage passed the companya blueeyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dolokhovmarching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song andlooking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at thatmoment marching with the company the hussar cornet of kutuzovssuite who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from thecarriage and rode up to dolokhovhussar cornet zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged tothe wild set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as aprivate and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov hadspoken to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality ofan old friendmy dear fellow how are you said he through the singing makinghis horse keep pace with the companyhow am i dolokhov answered coldly i am as you seethe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easygaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness ofdolokhovs replyand how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkovall right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto thestaffi was attached im on dutyboth were silentshe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went thesong arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulnesstheir conversation would probably have been different but for the effectof that songis it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhovthe devil only knows they say soim glad answered dolokhov briefly and clearly as the songdemandedi say come round some evening and well have a game of farosaid zherkovwhy have you too much moneydo comei cant ive sworn not

smiled dont trouble if i want anything i wontbegill take itwell never mind i onlyand i onlygoodbygood health its a long long way to my native landzherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly fromfoot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down gallopedpast the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to thesongchapter iiion returning from the review kutuzov took the austrian general intohis private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papersrelating to the condition of the troops on their arrival and theletters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command ofthe advanced army prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with therequired papers kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrathwere sitting at the table on which a plan was spread outah said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by thisexclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with theconversation in frenchall i can say general said he with a pleasant eleganceof expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to eachdeliberately spoken word it was evident that kutuzov himself listenedwith pleasure to his own voice all i can say general is that ifthe matter depended on my personal wishes the will of his majesty theemperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should longago have joined the archduke and believe me on my honour that to mepersonally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme commandof the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillfulgeneralof whom austria has so manyand to lay down all this heavyresponsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong for usgeneraland kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite atliberty not to believe me and i dont even care whether you do ornot but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the wholepointthe austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to replyin the same toneon the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone thatcontrasted with his flattering words on the contrary yourexcellencys participation in the common action is highly valued byhis majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendidrussian troops and their commander of the laurels they have beenaccustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidentlyprearranged sentencekutuzov bowed with the same smilebut that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with whichhis highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that theaustrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as generalmack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer needour aid said kutuzovthe general frowned though there was no definite news of an austriandefeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumorsthat were afloat and so kutuzovs suggestion of an austrian victorysounded much like irony but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with thesame expression which seemed to say that he had a right to supposeso and in fact the last letter he had received from macks armyinformed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of thearmy was very favorablegive me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrewplease have a look at itand kutuzov with an ironical smileabout the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general thefollowing passage in german from the archduke ferdinands letterwe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men withwhich to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech alsoas we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage ofcommanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy notcross the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his lineof communications recross the river lower down and frustrate hisintention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithfulally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperialrussian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction withit easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserveskutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at themember of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentivelybut you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expectthe worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have donewith jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at theaidedecampexcuse me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to princeandrew look here my dear fellow get from kozlovski all thereports from our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz andhere is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here arethese he said handing him several papers make a neat memorandumin french out of all this showing all the news we have had of themovements of the austrian army and then give it to his excellencyprince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from thefirst not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would haveliked to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to bothstepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting roomthough not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia hehad changed greatly during that period in the expression of his facein his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his formeraffected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has timeto think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied withagreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfactionwith himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighterand more attractivekutuzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindlypromised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutantsand had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissionsfrom vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade prince andrews fatheryour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industryfirmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such asubordinate by meon kutuzovs staff among his fellow officers and in the armygenerally prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society twoquite opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to bedifferent from themselves and from everyone else expected great thingsof him listened to him admired and imitated him and with them princeandrew was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him andconsidered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these peopleprince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and evenfeared himcoming out of kutuzovs room into the waiting room with the papers inhis hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the aidedecamp on dutykozlovski who was sitting at the window with a bookwell prince asked kozlovskii am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are notadvancingand why is itprince andrew shrugged his shouldersany news from macknoif it were true that he has been beaten news would have comeprobably said prince andrew moving toward the outer doorbut at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with theorder of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his headwho had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the doorprince andrew stopped shortcommander in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived generalspeaking quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides andadvancing straight toward the inner doorthe commander in chief is engaged said kozlovski goinghurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the doorwhom shall i announcethe unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who wasrather short as if surprised that anyone should not know himthe commander in chief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmlythe generals face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he tookout a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out theleaf gave it to kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threwhimself into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking whydo they look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck asif he intended to say something but immediately with affectedindifference began to hum to himself producing a queer sound whichimmediately broke off the door of the private room opened and kutuzovappeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forwardas though running away from some danger and making long quick strideswith his thin legs went up to kutuzovvous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voicekutuzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectlyimmobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a waveand his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfullyclosed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closedthe door himself behind himthe report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beatenand that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correctwithin half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions withorders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto beeninactive would also soon have to meet the enemyprince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interestlay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard thedetails of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lostunderstood all the difficulties of the russian armys position andvividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have toplay involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of thehumiliation of arrogant austria and that in a weeks time he mightperhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with thefrench since suvorov met them he feared that bonapartes geniusmight outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the sametime could not admit the idea of his hero being disgracedexcited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward hisroom to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridorhe met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherkovthey were as usual laughingwhy are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince andrewspale face and glittering eyestheres nothing to be gay about answered bolkonskijust as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came towardthem from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian generalwho was on kutuzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the russianarmy and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previousevening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals topass the three officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitskiaside with his arm said in a breathless voicetheyre coming theyre coming stand aside make wayplease make waythe generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoidembarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenlyappeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppressyour excellency said he in german stepping forward andaddressing the austrian general i have the honor to congratulateyouhe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with theother awkwardly like a child at a dancing lessonthe member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing theseriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a momentsattention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listeningi have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quitewell only a little bruised just here he added pointing with abeaming smile to his headthe general frowned turned away and went ongott wie naiv said he angrily after he had gone a few steps good god what simplicitynesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew butbolkonski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look andturned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearanceof mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before therussian army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely jestif you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he saidsharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i cant preventyour doing so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in mypresence i will teach you to behave yourselfnesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that theygazed at bolkonski silently with wideopen eyeswhats the matter i only congratulated them said zherkovi am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkonskiand taking nesvitskis arm he left zherkov who did not know what tosaycome whats the matter old fellow said nesvitski trying tosoothe himwhats the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still inhis excitement dont you understand that either we are officersserving our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes andgrieving at the misfortunes of our common cause or we are merelylackeys who care nothing for their masters business quarante millehommes massacres et larmee de nos allies detruite et voustrouvez la le mot pour rire he said as if strengthening hisviews by this french sentence cest bien pour un garcon de riencomme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami mais pas pour vous paspour vous only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in thisway he added in russianbut pronouncing the word with a frenchaccenthaving noticed that zherkov could still hear him forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed and you find that a cause for jesting it is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow of whom you have made a friend but not for you not for youhe waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turnedand went out of the corridorchapter ivthe pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau thesquadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered inthe german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village wereassigned to cavalrycaptain denisov the squadron commander knownthroughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov cadet rostovever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland had lived with

manure from the cowhouse looked out and his faceimmediately brightened on seeing rostov schon gut morgen schongut morgen he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleasedto greet the young man a

a dish ofsausages and a bottle of wineah youve come here too young man he said smiling andraising his eyebrowsyes said rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter theword and he sat down at the nearest tableboth were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in theroom no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knivesand the munching of the lieutenantwhen telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a doublepurse and drawing its rings aside with his small white turnedupfingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it tothe waiterplease be quick he saidthe coin was a new one rostov rose and went up to telyaninallow me to look at your purse he said in a low almostinaudible voicewith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised

eyessome flash as of an electric spark shot from telyanins eyes torostovs and back and back again and again in an instantcome here said rostov catching hold of telyanins arm andalmost dragging him to the window that money is denisovs youtook it he whispered just above telyanins earwhat what how dare you what said telyaninbut these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty forpardon as soon as rostov heard them an enormous load of doubtfell from him he was glad and at the same instant began to pity themiserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to becompletedheaven only knows what the people here may imagine mutteredtelyanin taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room wemust have an explanationi know it and shall prove it said rostovievery muscle of telyanins pale terrified face began to quiver hiseyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not risingto rostovs face and his sobs were audiblecount dont ruin a young fellow here is this wretched moneytake it he threw it on the table i have an old father andmotherrostov took the money avoiding telyanins eyes and went out of theroom without a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced hissteps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you doitcount said telyanin drawing nearer to himdont touch me said rostov drawing back if you need ittake the money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the innchapter vthat same evening there was an animated discussion among thesquadrons officers in denisovs quartersand i tell you rostov that you

thinking that hereone would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lyingso let himgive me satisfactionthats all right no one thinks you a coward but thats not thepoint ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet todemand satisfaction of his regimental commanderdenisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to theconversation evidently with no wish to take part in it

toward vienna destroying behind him the bridges overthe rivers inn at braunau and traun near linz on october therussian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russianbaggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defilingthrough the town of enns on both sides of the bridgeit was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened outbefore the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding thebridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain andthen suddenly spread out in the sunlight fardistant objects couldbe clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down belowthe little town could be seen with its white redroofed houses itscathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostlingmasses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an islandand a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence ofthe enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of thedanube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of greentreetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond awild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns theenemys horse patrols could be discernedamong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command ofthe rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country throughhis fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent tothe rearguard by the commander in chief was sitting on the trail of agun carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsackand a flask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and realdoppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on theirknees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grassyes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool itsa fine place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitskiwas sayingthank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleasedto be talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lovelyplace we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what asplendid houselook prince said another who would have dearly liked to takeanother pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining thecountrysidesee our infantrymen have already got there look therein the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging somethingtheyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approvalso they will said nesvitski no but what i should likeadded he munching a pie in his moistlipped handsome mouth would beto slip in over therehe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed andgleamedthat would be fine gentlementhe officers laughedjust to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girlsamong them on my word id give five years of my life for itthey must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officerslaughingmeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something tothe general who looked through his field glassyes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering thefield glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is theyll be firedon at the crossing and why are they dawdling thereon the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and fromtheir battery a milkwhite cloud arose then came the distant report ofa shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossingnesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smilingwould not your excellency like a little refreshment he saidits a bad business said the general without answering himour men have been wasting timehadnt i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitskiyes please do answered the general and he repeated the orderthat had already once been given in detail and tell the hussarsthat they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and theinflammable material on the bridge must be reinspectedvery good answered nesvitskihe called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsackand flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddleill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers whowatched him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down thehillnow then lets see how far it will carry captain just trysaid the general turning to an artillery officer have a little funto pass the timecrew to your guns commanded the officerin a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and beganloadingone came the commandnumber one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafeningmetallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of ourtroops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smokeshowing the spot where it burstthe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone gotup and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainlyvisible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of theapproaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fullyout from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shotand the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous andspirited impressionchapter viitwo of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge wherethere was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who hadalighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against therailings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a fewsteps behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time princenesvitski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back againand pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smilewhat a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoysoldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who werecrowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellowyou cant wait a moment dont you see the general wants to passbut the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shoutedat the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep tothe left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder toshoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a densemass looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisylittle waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles ofthe bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equallyuniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakosknapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces withbroad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions andfeet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of thebridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck ofwhite foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and witha type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way alongsometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on footan orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantryand sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers orcompanys baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in onall sides moved across the bridgeits as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly arethere many more of you to comea million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coatwith a wink and passed on followed by another an old manif he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge nowsaid the old soldier dismally to a comrade youll forget toscratch yourselfthat soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cartwhere the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said anorderly running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of itand he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers whohad evidently been drinkingand then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the buttend of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up saidgaily with a wide swing of his armyes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loudlaugh and they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn whohad been struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with itbah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think theyllall be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfullyas it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldierwith an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt likedying of fright i did pon my word i got that frightened saidhe as if bragging of having been frightenedthat one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gonebefore it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german andseemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow witha large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweanedbaby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheekswere sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives wereallowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiersturned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot paceall the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every facebore almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about thewomenjust see the german sausage is making tracks toosell me the missis said another soldier addressing the germanwho angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcasteyessee how smart shes made herself oh the devilsthere fedotov you should be quartered on themi have seen as much before now matewhere are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating anapple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girlthe german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understandtake it if you like said the officer giving the girl an applethe girl smiled and took it nesvitski like the rest of the men on thebridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed whenthey had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the samekind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses ofa convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the wholecrowd had to waitand why are they stopping theres no proper order said thesoldiers where are you shoving to devil take you cant you waititll be worse if he fires the bridge see heres an officer jammedin toodifferent voices were saying in the crowd as the men lookedat one another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridgelooking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitskisuddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approachingsomething big that splashed into the waterjust see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternlylooking round at the soundencouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasilythe crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ballhey cossack my horse he said now then you there get outof the way make waywith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shoutingcontinually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make wayfor him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and thosenearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed stillharder from behindnesvitski nesvitski you numskull came a hoarse voice frombehind himnesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separatedby the living mass of moving infantry vaska denisov red and shaggywith his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntilyover his shouldertell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisovevidently in a fit of rage his coalblack eyes with their bloodshotwhites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a smallbare hand as red as his faceah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski whats up withyouthe squadwon cant pass shouted vaska denisov showing hiswhite teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab whichtwitched its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurtingwhite foam from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with hishoofs and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider lethim what is this theyre like sheep just like sheep out of theway let us pass stop there you devil with the cart ill hackyou with my saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from itsscabbard and flourishing itthe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces anddenisov joined nesvitskihows it youre not drunk today said nesvitski when theother had ridden up to himthey dont even give one time to dwink answered vaskadenisov they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if theymean to fight lets fight but the devil knows what this iswhat a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking atdenisovs new cloak and saddleclothdenisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffuseda smell of perfume and put it to nesvitskis noseof course im going into action ive shaved bwushed my teethand scented myselfthe imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack andthe determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shoutedfrantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze throughto the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside thebridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the orderand having done this he rode backhaving cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridgecarelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing theground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron drawnearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses gallopingresounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers infront and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emergeon his side of itthe infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in thetrampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of illwillestrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usuallyencounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them inregular ordersmart lads only fit for a fair said onewhat good are they theyre led about just for show remarkedanotherdont kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whoseprancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiersid like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack yourfine cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wipingthe mud off his face with his sleeve perched up there youre morelike a bird than a manthere now zikin they ought to put you on a horse youd lookfine said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent underthe weight of his knapsacktake a stick between your legs thatll suit you for a horsethe hussar shouted backchapter viiithe last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezingtogether as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at lastthe baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the lastbattalion came onto the bridge only denisovs squadron of hussarsremained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who couldbe seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible fromthe bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which theriver flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile awayat the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of ourcossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the highground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were thefrench a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot allthe officers and men of denisovs squadron though they tried to talkof other things and to look in other directions thought only of whatwas there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patchesappearing on the skyline which they knew to be the enemys troopsthe weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descendingbrightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm andat intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heardfrom the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemyexcept a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundredyards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and thatstern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separatestwo hostile armies was all the more clearly feltone step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividingthe living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death andwhat is there who is therethere beyond that field that tree thatroof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fearand yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it mustbe crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you willinevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you arestrong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other suchexcitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any ratefeels anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling givesa particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything thattakes place at such momentson the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon roseand a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron theofficers who had been standing together rode off to their places thehussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the wholesquadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadroncommander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannonball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the ballswith rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fellsomewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the soundof each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with itsrows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while theball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldierswithout turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see theircomrades impression every face from denisovs to that of thebugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation andexcitement around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned lookingat the soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov duckedevery time a ball flew past rostov on the left flank mounted on hisrooka handsome horse despite its game leghad the happy air of aschoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in whichhe feels sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyonewith a clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmlyhe sat under fire but despite himself on his face too that sameindication of something new and stern showed round the mouthwhos that curtseying there cadet miwonov thats not wightlook at me cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spotkept turning his horse in front of the squadronthe black hairy snubnosed face of vaska denisov and his wholeshort sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers inwhich he held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usuallydid especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle hewas only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birdswhen they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of hisgood horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in thesaddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted ina hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up tokirsten the staff captain on his broadbacked steady mare came at awalk to meet him his face with its long mustache was serious as alwaysonly his eyes were brighter than usualwell what about it said he to denisov it wont come to afight youll seewe shall retirethe devil only knows what theyre about muttered denisovah wostov he cried noticing the cadets bright faceyouve got it at lastand he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostovfelt perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridgedenisov galloped up to himyour excellency let us attack them ill dwive them offattack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up hisface as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stoppinghere dont you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadronbackthe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire withouthaving lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the frontline followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther sideof the riverthe two pavlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up thehill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert cameup to denisovs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostovwithout taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for thefirst time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feelingthat he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he nowadmitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from thecolonels athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his redneck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending notto notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadetscourage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then itseemed to him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him hiscourage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on adesperate attack just to punish himrostov then he imagined howafter the attack bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded andwould magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliationthe highshouldered figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds ashe had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonelafter his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in theregiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when hecould get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeededin attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he nowcame to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rearguardcolonel he said addressing rostovs enemy with an air ofgloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an orderto stop and fire the bridgean order to who asked the colonel moroselyi dont myself know to who replied the cornet in aserious tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonelthat the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridgezherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to thecolonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitskicame galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry hisweighthows this colonel he shouted as he approached i told youto fire the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are allbeside themselves over there and one cant make anything outthe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitskiyou spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you saidnothing about firing itbut my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off hiscap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump handwasnt i telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable materialhad been put in positioni am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tellme to burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit ordersstrictly to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who wouldburn it i could not know by the holy spiritah thats always the way said nesvitski with a wave of thehand how did you get here said he turning to zherkovon the same business but you are damp let me wring you outyou were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in anoffended tonecolonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must bequick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshotthe colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stoutstaff officer and at zherkov and he frownedi will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announcethat in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would stilldo the right thingstriking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blamefor everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the secondsquadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return tothe bridgethere its just as i thought said rostov to himself hewishes to test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to hisface let him see whether i am a coward he thoughtagain on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expressionappeared that they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemythe colonel closelyto find in his face confirmation of his ownconjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and lookedas he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the wordof commandlook sharp look sharp several voices repeated around himtheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling thehussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the menwere crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel hehad no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraidthat his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse intoan orderlys charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart witha thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting somethingrostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurscatching and their sabers clatteringstretchers shouted someone behind himrostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran ontrying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge notlooking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbledand fell on his hands the others outstripped himat boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel whohaving ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with atriumphant cheerful facerostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy andwas about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the frontthe better but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostovshouted to himwhos that running on the middle of the bridge to the right comeback cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showingoff his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridgewhy run risks captain you should dismount he saidoh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turningin his saddlemeanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite werestanding together out of range of the shots watching now the smallgroup of men with yellow shakos darkgreen jackets braided with cordand blue riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then atwhat was approaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blueuniforms and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillerywill they burn the bridge or not wholl get there first will theyget there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshotrange and wipe them out these were the questions each man of thetroops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himselfwith a sinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the brightevening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side withtheir bayonets and gunsugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they arewithin grapeshot range nowhe shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of thesuitetrue enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could havedone the job just as wellah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on thehussars but still with that naive air that made it impossible to knowwhether he was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellencyhow you look at things send two men and who then would give us thevladimir medal and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered thesquadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon ourbogdanich knows how things are donethere now said the officer of the suite thatsgrapeshothe pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detachedand hurriedly removedon the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smokeappeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at themoment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then tworeports one after another and a thirdoh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing theofficer of the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallenfallentwo i thinkif i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turningawaythe french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blueuniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared againbut at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto thebridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening thereas a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded insetting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them nolonger to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there wassomeone to fire atthe french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussarsgot back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went toohigh but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars andknocked three of them overrostov absorbed by his relations with bogdanich had paused on thebridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as hehad always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire thebridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like theother soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard arattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearestto him fell against the rails with a groan rostov ran up to him withthe others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized thehussar and began lifting himoooh for christs sake let me alone cried the wounded man butstill he was lifted and laid on the stretchernicholas rostov turned away and as if searching for something gazedinto the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at thesun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deephow bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter thewaters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the farawayblue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges andthe pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peaceand happiness i should wish for nothing else nothing if only iwere there thought rostov in myself alone and in that sunshinethere is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear andthis uncertainty and hurry therethey are shouting again andagain are all running back somewhere and i shall run with them and itdeath is here above me and around another instant and i shall neveragain see the sun this water that gorgeat that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and otherstretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and ofthe stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into onefeeling of sickening agitationo lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protectme rostov whisperedthe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voicessounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sightwell fwiend so youve smelt powdah shouted vaska denisovjust above his earits all over but i am a cowardyes a coward thoughtrostov and sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood restingone foot from the orderly and began to mountwas that grapeshot he asked denisovyes and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegularbwicks and its nasty work an attacks pleasant work hackingaway at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil with themshooting at you like a targetand denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov composedof the colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the suitewell it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and thiswas true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensationwhich the cadet under fire for the first time had experiencedheres something for you to report said zherkov see if idont get promoted to a sublieutenancyinform the prince that i the bridge fired said the coloneltriumphantly and gailyand if he asks about the lossesa trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussarswounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happysmile and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringingdistinctnesschapter ixpursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the commandof bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to itlosing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of suppliesand compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that hadbeen foreseen the russian army of thirtyfive thousand men commandedby kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping whereovertaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far asnecessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipmentthere had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite thecourage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which therussians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet morerapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and hadjoined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army andkutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces thedefense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of anoffensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with themodern science of strategics had been handed to kutuzov when he was invienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainableaim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that wereadvancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulmon the twentyeighth of october kutuzov with his army crossed to theleft bank of the danube and took up a position for the first timewith the river between himself and the main body of the french on thethirtieth he attacked mortiers division which was on the left bankand broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were takenbanners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after afortnights retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fighthad not only held the field but had repulsed the french though thetroops were illclad exhausted and had lost a third of their numberin killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick andwounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letterin which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy andthough the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into militaryhospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet thestand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits ofthe army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquartersmost joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approachof columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and ofthe retreat of the frightened bonaparteprince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austriangeneral schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had beenwounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a markof the commander in chiefs special favor he was sent with the news ofthis victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which wasthreatened by the french but at brunn despite his apparently delicatebuild prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than manyvery muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrivedat krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov tokutuzov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunnto be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step towardpromotionthe night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow thathad fallen the previous daythe day of the battle reviewing hisimpressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself theimpression his news of a victory would create or recalling the sendoffgiven him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers princeandrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of aman who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happiness as soonas he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of thewheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine thatthe russians were running away and that he himself was killed but hequickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh thatthis was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away heagain recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courageduring the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the darkstarry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow wasthawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sidesof the road were forests of different kinds fields and villagesat one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian woundedthe russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the frontcart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each ofthe long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were beingjolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russianwords others were eating bread the more severely wounded lookedsilently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoyhurrying past themprince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in whataction they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danubeanswered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave thesoldier three gold piecesthats for them all he said to the officer who came upget well soon lads he continued turning to the soldierstheres plenty to do stillwhat news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start aconversationgood news go on he shouted to the driver and they gallopedonit was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the pavedstreets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings thelights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all thatatmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to asoldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless nightprince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous andalert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishlyand his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness andrapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longerdim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himselfstating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casualquestions that might be put to him and the answers he would give heexpected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entranceto the palace however an official came running out to meet him andlearning that he was a special messenger led him to another entranceto the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will findthe adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you tothe minister of warthe adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and wentin to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowingwith particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along acorridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work theadjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off anyattempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messengerprince andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as heapproached the door of the ministers room he felt offended andwithout his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned intoone of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantlysuggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despisethe adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder theyprobably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyesnarrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war withpeculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightenedwhen he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papersand making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three minutestaking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of theministers bent bald head with its gray temples he went on readingto the end without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and thesound of footstepstake this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him thepapers and still taking no notice of the special messengerprince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzovs armyinterested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he wasconcerned with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger thatimpression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me hethought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged themevenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctivehead but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligentexpression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate andhabitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile whichdoes not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who iscontinually receiving many petitioners one after anotherfrom general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it isgood news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it washigh timehe took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read itwith a mournful expressionoh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what acalamity what a calamityhaving glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and lookedat prince andrew evidently considering somethingah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier isnot captured again he pondered i am very glad you have broughtgood news though schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for thevictory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today ithank you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after theparade however i will let you knowthe stupid smile which had left his face while he was speakingreappearedau revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire tosee you he added bowing his headwhen prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interestand happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in theindifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant thewhole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemedthe memory of a remote event long pastchapter xprince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin a russian acquaintance ofhis in the diplomatic serviceah my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitorsaid bilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put theprinces things in my bedroom said he to the servant who wasushering bolkonski in so youre a messenger of victory ehsplendid and i am sitting here ill as you seeafter washing and dressing prince andrew came into the diplomatsluxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibinsettled down comfortably beside the fireafter his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived ofall the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life princeandrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings suchas he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasantafter his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russianfor they were speaking french at least with a russian who would hesupposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which wasthen particularly strongbilibin was a man of thirtyfive a bachelor and of the same circle asprince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg buthad become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzovjust as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising highin the military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin gavepromise of rising in his diplomatic career he was still a young man butno longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the ageof sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a ratherimportant post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassadorin vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those manydiplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualitiesavoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of thosewho liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence wouldsometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked wellwhatever the import of his work it was not the question what forbut the question how that interested him what the diplomaticmatter might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure toprepare a circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly andelegantly bilibins services were valued not only for what he wrotebut also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in thehighest spheresbilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could bemade elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to saysomething striking and took part in a conversation only when that waspossible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily originalfinished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in theinner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally sothat insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room todrawing room and in fact bilibins witticisms were hawked aboutin the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on mattersconsidered importanthis thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which alwayslooked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers after arussian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal playof expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep foldsand his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend anddeep wrinkles would crease his cheeks his small deepset eyes alwaystwinkled and looked out straightwell now tell me about your exploits said hebolkonski very modestly without once mentioning himself described theengagement and his reception by the minister of warthey received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game ofskittles said he in conclusionbilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappearedcependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from adistance and puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la hauteestime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army javoue quevotre victoire nest pas des plus victorieuses but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russian army i must say that your victory was not particularly victorioushe went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words inrussian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasiscome now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortierand his one division and even then mortier slips through your fingerswheres the victorybut seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate saywithout boasting that it was a little better than at ulmwhy didnt you capture one just one marshal for usbecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothnessof a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear byseven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoonand why didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to havebeen there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smileyou ought to have been there at seven in the morningwhy did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomaticmethods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrewin the same tonei know interrupted bilibin youre thinking its veryeasy to take marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true butstill why didnt you capture him so dont be surprised if not onlythe minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor andking francis is not much delighted by your victory even i a poorsecretary of the russian embassy do not feel any need in token of myjoy to give my franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to theprater true we have no prater herehe looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled hisforeheadit is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkonskii confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomaticsubtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence but i cant make itout mack loses a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archdukekarl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder kutuzovalone at last gains a real victory destroying the spell of theinvincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even careto hear the detailsthats just it my dear fellow you see its hurrah for the tsarfor russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful butwhat do we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bringus nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand onearchdukes as good as another as you know and even if it is onlyover a fire brigade of bonapartes that will be another story andwell fire off some cannon but this sort of thing seems doneon purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing the archdukeferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up itsdefenseas much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help youand your capital the one general whom we all loved schmidt youexpose to a bullet and then you congratulate us on the victory admitthat more irritating news than yours could not have been conceivedits as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides supposeyou did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke karl gained avictory what effect would that have on the general course of eventsits too late now when vienna is occupied by the french armywhat occupied vienna occupiednot only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the countour dear count vrbna goes to him for ordersafter the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception andespecially after having dined bolkonski felt that he could not take inthe full significance of the words he heardcount lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin continuedand showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in viennawas fully described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see thatyour victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant bereceived as a saviorreally i dont care about that i dont care at all saidprince andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battlebefore krems was really of small importance in view of such events asthe fall of austrias capital how is it vienna was taken what ofthe bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heardreports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he saidprince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and isdefending usdoing it very badly i think but still he is defendingus but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet beentaken and i hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have beengiven to blow it up otherwise we should long ago have been in themountains of bohemia and you and your army would have spent a badquarter of an hour between two firesbut still this does not mean that the campaign is over saidprince andrewwell i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but theydarent say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaignit wont be your skirmishing at durrenstein or gunpowder at allthat will decide the matter but those who devised it said bilibinquoting one of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead andpausing the only question is what will come of the meeting betweenthe emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussiajoins the allies austrias hand will be forced and there will be warif not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries ofthe new campo formio are to be drawn upwhat an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimedclenching his small hand and striking the table with it and whatluck the man hasbuonaparte said bilibin inquiringly puckering up his foreheadto indicate that he was about to say something witty buonapartehe repeated accentuating the u i think however now that he laysdown laws for austria at schonbrunn il faut lui faire grace delu i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simplybonaparte we must let him off the ubut joking apart said prince andrew do you really think thecampaign is overthis is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she isnot used to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in thefirst place because her provinces have been pillagedthey say the holyrussian army loots terriblyher army is destroyed her capitaltaken and all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty andthereforethis is between ourselvesi instinctively feel that weare being deceived my instinct tells me of negotiations with france andprojects for peace a secret peace concluded separately fine eyesimpossible cried prince andrew that would be too baseif we live we shall see replied bilibin his face again becomingsmooth as a sign that the conversation was at an endwhen prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in aclean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows hefelt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far faraway from him the alliance with prussia austrias treacherybonapartes new triumph tomorrows levee and parade and theaudience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughtshe closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketryand the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and nowagain drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hillthe french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rodeforward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all aroundand he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done sincechildhoodhe woke upyes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himselflike a child he fell into a deep youthful slumberchapter xinext day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the firstthought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presentedto the emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the politeaustrian adjutant bilibin and last nights conversation havingdressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which hehad not worn for a long time he went into bilibins study freshanimated and handsome with his hand bandaged in the study were fourgentlemen of the diplomatic corps with prince hippolyte kuraginwho was a secretary to the embassy bolkonski was already acquaintedbilibin introduced him to the othersthe gentlemen assembled at bilibins were young wealthy gay societymen who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilibin theirleader called les notres this set consisting almost exclusively ofdiplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do withwar or politics but related to high society to certain women and tothe official side of the service these gentlemen received princeandrew as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many frompoliteness and to start conversation they asked him a few questionsabout the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merryjests and gossip oursbut the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune ofa fellow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that hisappointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard itcan you fancy the figure he cutbut the worst of it gentlemeni am giving kuragin away toyouis that that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow istaking advantage of itprince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over itsarm he began to laughtell me about that he saidoh you don juan you serpent cried several voicesyou bolkonski dont know said bilibin turning to princeandrew that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said ofthe russian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doingamong the womenla femme est la compagne de lhomme announced princehippolyte and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs woman is mans companionbilibin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in hippolytesface and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whomhe had toadmithe had almost been jealous on his wifes account was the buttof this setoh i must give you a treat bilibin whispered to bolkonskikuragin is exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see hisgravityhe sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talkingto him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round thesetwothe berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance beganhippolyte gazing round with importance at the others withoutexpressing as in its last note you understand besides unlesshis majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliancewait i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizinghim by the arm i believe that intervention will be stronger thannonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute thenonreceipt of our dispatch of november that is how it will endand he released bolkonskis arm to indicate that he had now quitefinisheddemosthenes i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy goldenmouth said bilibin and the mop of hair on his head moved withsatisfactioneverybody laughed and hippolyte louder than anyone he was evidentlydistressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wildlaughter that convulsed his usually impassive featureswell now gentlemen said bilibin bolkonski is my guest inthis house and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as ican with all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it wouldbe easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficultand i beg you all to help me brunns attractions must be shown himyou can undertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of coursethe womenwe must let him see amelie shes exquisite said one ofours kissing his finger tipsin general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humaneinterests said bilibini shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitalitygentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrewlooking at his watchwhere toto the emperoroh oh ohwell au revoir bolkonski au revoir prince come back early todinner cried several voices well take you in handwhen speaking to the emperor try as far as you can to praise the waythat provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said bilibinaccompanying him to the halli should like to speak well of them but as far as i know the factsi cant replied bolkonski smilingwell talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for givingaudiences but he does not like talking himself and cant do it asyou will seechapter xiiat the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he hadbeen told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into hisface and just nodded to him with his long head but after it wasover the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informedbolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperorfrancis received him standing in the middle of the room before theconversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperorseemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to saytell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedlyprince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simplewas kutuzov well when had he left krems and so on the emperorspoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionstheanswers to these questions as was only too evident did not interesthimat what oclock did the battle begin asked the emperori cannot inform your majesty at what oclock the battle began atthe front but at durrenstein where i was our attack began afterfive in the afternoon replied bolkonski growing more animated andexpecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account whichhe had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperorsmiled and interrupted himhow many milesfrom where to where your majestyfrom durrenstein to kremsthree and a half miles your

house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on themaria theresa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferringon him the empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty thearchduchess also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer andfor a few seconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassadortook him by the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk tohimcontrary to bilibins forecast the news he had brought was joyfullyreceived a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was awardedthe grand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewardsbolkonski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morningcalling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and fivein the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning tobilibins house thinking out a letter to his father about the battleand his visit to brunn at the door he found a vehicle half full ofluggage franz bilibins man was dragging a portmanteau with somedifficulty out of the front doorbefore returning to bilibins prince andrew had gone to a bookshopto provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent sometime in the shopwhat is it he askedoh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling theportmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther thescoundrel is again at our heelseh what asked prince andrewbilibin came out

the road to brunn and will be here in a day ortwowhat here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it wasminedthat is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows whybolkonski shrugged his

thedanube marching on us you and your lines of communication the marshallsstop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this newsgrieved him and yet he was pleasedas soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopelesssituation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead itout of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him fromthe ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to famelistening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the armyhe would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only onethat could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with theexecuting of the planstop this jesting he saidi am not jesting bilibin went on nothing is truer or sadderthese gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefsthey assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are ontheir way to negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter thetetedepont they spin him a thousand gasconades saying thatthe war is over that the emperor francis is arranging a meeting withbonaparte that they desire to see prince auersperg and so on theofficer sends for auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crackjokes sit on the cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets tothe bridge unobserved flings the bags of incendiary material intothe water and approaches the tetedepont at length appears thelieutenant general our dear prince auersperg von mautern himselfdearest foe flower of the austrian army hero of the turkish warshostilities are ended we can shake one anothers hand theemperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince auerspergsacquaintance in a word those gentlemen gascons indeed sobewildered him with fine words and he is so flattered by his rapidlyestablished intimacy with the french marshals and so dazzled by thesight of murats mantle and ostrich plumes quil ny voit que dufeu et oublie celui quil devait faire faire sur lennemi in spite of the animation of his speech bilibin did not forget topause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation thefrench battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and thebridge is taken but what is best of all he went on his excitementsubsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that thesergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to firethe mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the frenchtroops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannesstayed his hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than his generalgoes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived hereare the french murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant isallowed to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is atrue gascon and says i dont recognize the worldfamous austriandiscipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that itwas a stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake andorders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this affairof the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity norrascality bridgehead that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemyit may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining thegray overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firingand the glory that awaited himnot that either that puts the court in too bad a light repliedbilibin its not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it isjust as at ulm it ishe seemed to be trying to find the rightexpression cest cest du mack nous sommes mackes it isit is a bit of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that hehad produced a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated hishitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with aslight smile he began to examine his nailswhere are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who hadrisen and was going toward his roomi am going awaywhere toto the armybut you meant to stay another two daysbut now i am off at onceand prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went tohis roomdo you know mon cher said bilibin following him i have beenthinking about you why are you goingand in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinklesvanished from his faceprince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no replywhy are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back tothe army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher it isheroismnot at all said prince andrewbut as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the otherside of the question and you will see that your duty on the contraryis to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit foranything else you have not been ordered to return and have not beendismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever ourill luck takes us they say we are going to olmutz and olmutz is avery decent town you and i will travel comfortably in my calechedo stop joking bilibin cried bolkonskii am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why areyou going when you might remain here you are faced by one of twothings and the skin over his left temple puckered either youwill not reach your regiment before peace is concluded or you willshare defeat and disgrace with kutuzovs whole armyand bilibin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma wasinsolublei cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but hethought i am going to save the armymy dear fellow you are a hero said bilibinchapter xiiithat same night having taken leave of the minister of war bolkonskiset off to rejoin the army not knowing where he would find it andfearing to be captured by the french on the way to kremsin brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavybaggage was already being dispatched to olmutz near hetzelsdorf princeandrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving withgreat haste and in the greatest disorder the road was so obstructedwith carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrewtook a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and hungry andweary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of thecommander in chief and of his own luggage very sinister reports of theposition of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance ofthe troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumorscette armee russe que lor de langleterre a transportee desextremites de lunivers nous allons lui faire eprouver le memesortle sort de larmee dulm he remembered these wordsin bonapartes address to his army at the beginning of the campaignand they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero a feelingof wounded pride and a hope of glory and should there be nothingleft but to die he thought well if need be i shall do it noworse than others that russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by english gold we shall cause to share the same fatethe fate of the army at ulmhe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachmentscarts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of allkinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three andsometimes four abreast from all sides behind and before as far as earcould reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of cartsand gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts theurging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officersall along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen someflayed some not and brokendown carts beside which solitary soldierssat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from theircompanies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages orreturned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks ateach ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and thedin of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering kneedeep in mudpushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slippedtraces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officersdirecting the march rode backward and forward between the carts theirvoices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their facesthat they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorderhere is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkonskirecalling bilibins wordswishing to find out where the commander in chief was he rode up toa convoy directly opposite to him came a strange onehorse vehicleevidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials andlooking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a calechea soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind theapron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode upand was just putting his question to a soldier when his attentionwas diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle anofficer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was drivingthe womans vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokesof his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamedpiercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apronand waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl criedmr aidedecamp mr aidedecamp for heavens sake protectme what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventhchasseurs they wont let us pass we are left behind and have lostour peopleill flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer tothe soldier turn back with your slutmr aidedecamp help me what does it all mean screamed thedoctors wifekindly let this cart pass dont you see its a woman saidprince andrew riding up to the officerthe officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to thesoldier ill teach you to push on backlet them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing hislipsand who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsyrage who are you are you in command here eh i am commander herenot you go back or ill flatten you into a pancake repeated hethis expression evidently pleased himthat was a nice snub for the little aidedecamp came a voicefrom behindprince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senselesstipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that hischampionship of the doctors wife in her queer trap might expose himto what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule buthis instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentenceprince andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raisedhis riding whipkindly letthempassthe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode awayits all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theresthis disorder he muttered do as you likeprince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from thedoctors wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling witha sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene hegalloped on to the village where he was told who the commander in chiefwason reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest houseintending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sortout the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind thisis a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he wentup to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him bynamehe turned round nesvitskis handsome face looked out of the littlewindow nesvitski moving his moist lips as he chewed something andflourishing his arm called him to enterbolkonski bolkonski dont you hear eh come quick heshoutedentering the house prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutanthaving something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if hehad any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarmthis was particularly noticeable on nesvitskis usually laughingcountenancewhere is the commander in chief asked bolkonskihere in that house answered the adjutantwell is it true that its peace and capitulation askednesvitskii was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i coulddo to get hereand we my dear boy its terrible i was wrong to laugh at mackwere getting it still worse said nesvitski but sit down andhave something to eatyou wont be able to find either your baggage or anything else nowprince and god only knows where your man peter is said the otheradjutantwhere are headquarterswe

fellow butwhats the matter with you you must be ill to shiver like that headded noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shockits nothing replied prince andrewhe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife andthe convoy officerwhat is the commander in chief doing here he askedi cant make out at all said nesvitskiwell all i can make out is that everything is abominableabominable quite abominable said prince andrew and he went off tothe house where the commander in chief waspassing by kutuzovs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses ofhis suite with their cossacks who were talking loudly together princeandrew entered the passage kutuzov himself he was told was in thehouse with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austriangeneral who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozlovski wassquatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turnedup was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards kozlovskisface looked wornhe too had evidently not slept all night he glancedat prince andrew and did not even nod to himsecond line have you written it he continued dictating to theclerk the kiev grenadiers podolianone cant write so fast your honor said the clerk glancingangrily and disrespectfully at kozlovskithrough the door came the sounds of kutuzovs voice excited anddissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from thesound of these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him thedisrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk andkozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commanderin chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding thehorses near the window prince andrew felt that something important anddisastrous was about to happenhe turned to kozlovski with urgent questionsimmediately prince said kozlovski dispositions forbagrationwhat about capitulationnothing of the sort orders are issued for a battleprince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heardjust as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened andkutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorwayprince andrew stood right in front of kutuzov but the expression ofthe commander in chiefs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupiedwith thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence helooked straight at his adjutants face without recognizing himwell have you finished said he to kozlovskione moment your excellencybagration a gaunt middleaged man of medium height with a firmimpassive face of oriental type came out after the commander in chiefi have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew ratherloudly handing kutuzov an envelopeah from vienna very good later laterkutuzov went out into the porch with bagrationwell goodby prince said he to bagration my blessing andmay christ be with you in your great endeavorhis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his lefthand he drew bagration toward him and with his right on which he worea ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidentlyhabitual offering his puffy cheek but bagration kissed him on theneck insteadchrist be with you kutuzov repeated and went toward hiscarriage get in with me said he to bolkonskiyour excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remainwith prince bagrations detachmentget in said kutuzov and noticing that bolkonski still delayedhe added i need good officers myself need them myselfthey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silencethere is still much much before us he said as if with an oldmans penetration he understood all that was passing in bolkonskismind if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank godhe added as if speaking to himselfprince andrew glanced at kutuzovs face only a foot distant from himand involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar nearhis temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the emptyeye socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those mensdeath thought bolkonskithat is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he saidkutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had beensaying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swayingon the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrewthere was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony hequestioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with theemperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the kremsaffair and about some ladies they both knewchapter xivon november kutuzov had received through a spy news that the armyhe commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported thatthe french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing inimmense force upon kutuzovs line of communication with the troopsthat were arriving from russia if kutuzov decided to remain at kremsnapoleons army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut himoff completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and hewould find himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutuzov decidedto abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russiahe would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemianmountains defending himself against superior forces of the enemy andabandoning all hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutuzov decidedto retreat along the road from krems to olmutz to unite with thetroops arriving from russia he risked being forestalled on that roadby the french who had crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by hisbaggage and transport having to accept battle on the march against anenemy three times as strong who would hem him in from two sideskutuzov chose this latter coursethe french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge wereadvancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixtysix milesoff on the line of kutuzovs retreat if he reached znaim before thefrench there would be great hope of saving the army to let thefrench forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to adisgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestallthe french with his whole army was impossible the road for the frenchfrom vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for therussians from krems to znaimthe night he received the news kutuzov sent bagrations vanguardfour thousand strong to the right across the hills from the kremsznaimto the viennaznaim road bagration was to make this march withoutresting and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if hesucceeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long aspossible kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road toznaimmarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with hishungry illshod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglersby the way bagration came out on the viennaznaim road at hollabrunna few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn fromvienna kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some daysbefore he could reach znaim hence bagration with his four thousandhungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy armythat came upon him at hollabrunn which was clearly impossible buta freak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trickthat had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french withouta fight led murat to try to deceive kutuzov in a similar way meetingbagrations weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to bekutuzovs whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaitedthe arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from viennaand with this object offered a three days truce on condition thatboth armies should remain in position without moving murat declaredthat negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that hetherefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed countnostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts believedmurats emissary and retired leaving bagrations divisionexposed another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peacenegotiations and to offer the russian army the three days trucebagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refusea truce and sent his adjutant to kutuzov to report the offer he hadreceiveda truce was kutuzovs sole chance of gaining time givingbagrations exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport andheavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french advanceif but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only anda quite unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the newshe immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was inattendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merelyto agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation andmeanwhile kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost themovements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the kremsznaimroad bagrations exhausted and hungry detachment which alonecovered this movement of the transport and of the whole army had toremain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itselfkutuzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation which werein no way binding might give time for part of the transport to passand also that murats mistake would very soon be discovered provedcorrect as soon as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen milesfrom hollabrunn received murats dispatch with the proposal of atruce and a capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the followingletter to muratschonbrunn th brumaire at eight oclock in the morningto prince murati cannot find words to express to you my displeasure you command onlymy advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without myorder you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign breakthe armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that thegeneral who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that noone but the emperor of russia has that rightif however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i willratify it but it is only a trick march on destroy the russianarmy you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillerythe russian emperors aidedecamp is an impostor officers arenothing when they have no powers this one had none the austrianslet themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you areletting yourself be tricked by an aidedecamp of the emperornapoleonbonapartes adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter tomurat bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with allthe guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victimescape and bagrations four thousand men merrily lighted campfiresdried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first timefor three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in storefor himchapter xvbetween three and four oclock in the afternoon prince andrew whohad persisted in his request to kutuzov arrived at grunth and reportedhimself to bagration bonapartes adjutant had not yet reachedmurats detachment and the battle had not yet begun in bagrationsdetachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs theytalked of peace but did not believe in its possibility others talkedof a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagementbagration knowing bolkonski to be a favorite and trusted adjutantreceived him with distinction and special marks of favor explaining tohim that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next andgiving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to jointhe rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is alsovery importanthowever there will hardly be an engagement today said bagrationas if to reassure prince andrewif he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn amedal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if hewishes to stay with me let him hell be of use here if hes abrave officer thought bagration prince andrew without replyingasked the princes permission to ride round the position to see thedisposition of the forces so as to know his bearings should he be sentto execute an order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressedman with a diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speakingfrench though he spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrewon all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces whoseemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benchesand fencing from the villagethere now prince we cant stop those fellows said the staffofficer pointing to the soldiers the officers dont keep them inhand and there he pointed to a sutlers tent they crowd inand sit this morning i turned them all out and now look its fullagain i must go there prince and scare them a bit it wont take amomentyes lets go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheesesaid prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anythingwhy didnt you mention it prince i would have offered yousomethingthey dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed andweary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinkingnow what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer inthe reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing morethan once you know it wont do to leave your posts like thisthe prince gave orders that no one should leave his post now youcaptain and he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer whowithout his boots he had given them to the canteen keeper to dryin only his stockings rose when they entered smiling not altogethercomfortablywell arent you ashamed of yourself captain tushin hecontinued one would think that as an artillery officer you would seta good example yet here you are without your boots the alarm will besounded and youll be in a pretty position without your boots thestaff officer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all ofyou all he added in a tone of commandprince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officertushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot tothe other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyesfrom prince andrew to the staff officerthe soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captaintushin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishingto adopt a jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that hisjest was unacceptable and had not come off he grew confusedkindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying topreserve his gravityprince andrew glanced again at the artillery officers small figurethere was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comicbut extremely attractivethe staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode onhaving ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtakingsoldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left someentrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed upred several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despitethe cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white antsspadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind thebank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked atthe entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon somedozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from theentrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to atrot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrinesvoila lagrement des camps monsieur le prince said thestaff officer this is a pleasure one gets in camp princethey rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already beseen prince andrew stopped and began examining the positionthats our battery said the staff officer indicating thehighest point its in charge of the queer fellow we saw withouthis boots you can see everything from there lets go thereprincethank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrewwishing to rid himself of this staff officers company pleasedont trouble yourself furtherthe staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alonethe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly andcheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had beenin the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road sevenmiles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarmcould be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines themore confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers intheir greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and companyofficers were counting the men poking the last man in each section inthe ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered overthe whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were buildingshelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat othersdressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mendingboots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookersin one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerlyat the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermastersergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a logbefore his shelter had been tastedanother company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodkacrowded round a pockmarked broadshouldered sergeant major who tiltinga keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him thesoldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential facesemptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away fromthe sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips andwiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces wereas serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peacefulencampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action inwhich at least half of them would be left on the field after passing achasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiersfine fellowsbusy with similar peaceful affairsnear the shelter of the regimentalcommander higher than and different from the others prince andrew cameout in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man twosoldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches andstriking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturallya stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of thescreams kept repeatingits a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honesthonorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor inhim hes a scoundrel go on go onso the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnaturalscreams continuedgo on go on said the majora young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his facestepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutantas he rode byprince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our frontline and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanksbut in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed thatmorning the lines were so near together that the men could see oneanothers faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers whoformed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookerswho jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemiessince early morningdespite an injunction not to approach the picketlinethe officers had been unable to keep sightseers away thesoldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosityno longer looked at the french but paid attention to the sightseers andgrew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a lookat the frenchlook look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to arussian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer andwas rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to himjabbering fine isnt it its all the frenchy can do to keep upwith him there now sidorovwait a bit and listen its fine answered sidorov who wasconsidered an adept at frenchthe soldier to whom the laughers referred was dolokhov prince andrewrecognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dolokhovhad come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed withhis captainnow then go on go on incited the officer bending forward andtrying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible tohim more please more whats he sayingdolokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hotdispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about thecampaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians wastrying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled allthe way from ulm while dolokhov maintained that the russians had notsurrendered but had beaten the frenchwe have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you offsaid dolokhovonly take care you and your cossacks are not all captured saidthe french grenadierthe french onlookers and listeners laughedwell make you dance as we did under suvorov saiddolokhov on vous fera danserqu estce quil chante asked a frenchman whats he singing aboutits ancient history said another guessing that it referred toa former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught theothersbonaparte began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted himnot bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrilythe devil skin your emperorand dolokhov swore at him in coarse soldiers russian and shoulderinghis musket walked awaylet us go ivan lukich he said to the captainah thats the way to talk french said the picket soldiersnow sidorov you have a trysidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaninglesssounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he saidtrying to give an expressive intonation to his voiceho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthyand goodhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the frenchinvoluntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to beto unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home asquickly as possiblebut the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses andentrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannonconfronted one another as beforechapter xvihaving ridden round the whole line from right flank to left princeandrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer hadtold him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stoppedbeside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns anartillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when theofficer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacingbehind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropesand artillerymens bonfires to the left not far from the farthestcannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came thesound of officers voices in eager conversationit was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and thegreater part of the enemys opened out from this battery just facingit on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon graberncould be seen and in three places to left and right the french troopsamid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom wereevidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left fromthat village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but itwas impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank wasposted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french positionour infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point thedragoons in the center where tushins battery stood and from whichprince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and mostdirect descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schongrabern on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smokedthe bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line waswider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank uson both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making itdifficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew tookout his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of theposition he made some notes on two points intending to mention them tobagration his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in thecenter and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of thedip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closelyfollowing the mass movements and general orders and constantly studyinghistorical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself thecourse of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline heimagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the rightflank he said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolskchasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the centercome up in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flankcounterattack if they attack our center we having the center batteryon this high ground shall withdraw the left flank under its cover andretreat to the dip by echelons so he reasoned all the timehe had been beside the gun he had heard the voices of the officersdistinctly but as often happens had not understood a word of what theywere saying suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from theshed and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listenno friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew afamiliar voice what i say is that if it were possible to knowwhat is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it thats sofriendanother a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you cantescape it anyhowall the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a thirdmanly voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men arevery wise because you can take everything along with youvodka andsnacksand the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officerlaughedyes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of thefamiliar voice one is afraid of the unknown thats what it iswhatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there isno sky but only an atmospherethe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officerwell stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it saidwhy thought prince andrew thats the captain who stood upin the sutlers hut without his boots he recognized the agreeablephilosophizing voice with pleasuresome herb vodka certainly said tushin but still toconceive a future lifehe did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer andnearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if ithad not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground nearthe shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the groundseemed to groan at the terrible impactand immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouthand his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shedfollowed by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer whohurried off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ranchapter xviimounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the batterylooking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyesran rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hithertomotionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really wasa battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed twomounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill asmall but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hillprobably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot hadnot yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a reportthe battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped backto grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind himgrowing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to replyfrom the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place camethe report of musketrylemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonapartes stern letterand murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at oncemoved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russianwings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor tocrush the contemptible detachment that stood before himit has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling theblood rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon presentitselfpassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinkingvodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapidmovement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets readyand on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled hisheart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was whatthe face of each soldier and each officer seemed to saybefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he sawin the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward himthe foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding awhite horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting forhim to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizingprince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrewtold him what he had seenthe feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on princebagrations hard brown face with its halfclosed dull sleepy eyesprince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive faceand wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinkingand feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind thatimpassive face prince andrew asked himself as he looked princebagration bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrewtold him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply thateverything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what hehad foreseen prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spokequickly prince bagration uttering his words with an oriental accentspoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was noneed to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the directionof tushins battery prince andrew followed with the suite behindprince bagration rode an officer of the suite the princes personaladjutant zherkov an orderly officer the staff officer on dutyriding a fine bobtailed horse and a civilianan accountant who hadasked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity theaccountant a stout fullfaced man looked around him with a naivesmile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among thehussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted onhis horse with a convoy officers saddlehe wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkonski pointingto the accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomachalreadyoh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rathercunning smile as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkovsjoke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really wasit is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officerhe remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing aprince but could not get it quite rightby this time they were all approaching tushins battery and a ballstruck the ground in front of themwhats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naivesmilea french pancake answered zherkovso thats what they hit with asked the accountant howawfulhe seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speakingwhen they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenlyended with a thud into something soft ffflop and a cossack ridinga little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth withhis horse zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles andturned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossackand examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but thehorse still struggledprince bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing thecause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to sayis it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse withthe care of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged hissaber which had caught in his cloak it was an oldfashioned saber ofa kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story ofsuvorov giving his saber to bagration in italy and the recollectionwas particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the batteryat which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefieldwhose company asked prince bagration of an artilleryman standingby the ammunition wagonhe asked whose company but he really meant are youfrightened here and the artilleryman understood himcaptain tushins your excellency shouted the redhairedfreckled gunner in a merry voice standing to attentionyes yes muttered bagration as if considering something and herode past the limbers to the farthest cannonas he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and hissuite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could seethe gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to itsformer position a huge broadshouldered gunner number one holdinga mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two witha trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth the shortroundshouldered captain tushin stumbling over the tail of the guncarriage moved forward and not noticing the general looked outshading his eyes with his small handlift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in afeeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note illsuited tohis weak figure number two he squeaked fire medvedevbagration called to him and tushin raising three fingers to his capwith a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salutebut like a priests benediction approached the general thoughtushins guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he wasfiring incendiary balls at the village of schon grabern visible justopposite in front of which large masses of french were advancingno one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but afterconsulting his sergeant major zakharchenko for whom he had greatrespect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to thevillage very good said bagration in reply to the officersreport and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extendedbefore him the french had advanced nearest on our right below theheight on which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where therivulet flowed the soulstirring rolling and crackling of musketry washeard and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer ofthe suite pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflankingus to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood princebagration ordered two battalions from the center to be sent toreinforce the right flank the officer of the suite ventured to remarkto the prince that if these battalions went away the guns would remainwithout support prince bagration turned to the officer and with hisdull eyes looked at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that theofficers remark was just and that really no answer could be made toit but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from thecommander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense massesof the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was indisorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagrationbowed his head in sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk tothe right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack thefrench but this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news thatthe commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip inthe ground as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losingmen uselessly and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into thewoodvery good said bagrationas he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also andas it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go therehimself prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in commandthe one who had paraded his regiment before kutuzov at braunau thathe must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rearas the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemysattack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been insupport of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listenedattentively to bagrations colloquies with the commanding officersand the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orderswere really given but that prince bagration tried to make it appearthat everything done by necessity by accident or by the will ofsubordinate commanders was done if not by his direct command at leastin accord with his intentions prince andrew noticed however thatthough what happened was due to chance and was independent of thecommanders will owing to the tact bagration showed his presencewas very valuable officers who approached him with disturbedcountenances became calm soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grewmore cheerful in his presence and were evidently anxious to displaytheir courage before himchapter xviiiprince bagration having reached the highest point of our right flankbegan riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but whereon account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got tothe hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearnessof the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with ableeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers whosupported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and hewas spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat ormouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musketgroaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt whileblood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he hadthat moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than sufferingcrossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several menlying on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom wereunwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily anddespite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulatingin front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through thesmoke and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting afterthe crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagration rode upto the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowningthe sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked withsmoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it somewere using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans ortaking charges from their pouches while others were firing though whothey were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was nowind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets wereoften heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching thecrowd of soldiers it cant be an attack for they are not movingit cant be a squarefor they are not drawn up for thatthe commander of the regiment a thin feeblelooking old man with apleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyesgiving him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him asa host welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment hadbeen attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had beenrepulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attackhad been repulsed employing this military term to describe what hadoccurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know whathad happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him andcould not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or hisregiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencementof the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment andhitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry andour men had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalrywhich had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into thehollow and were firing at our men prince bagration bowed his head as asign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected turningto his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of thesixth chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck bythe changed expression on prince bagrations face at this moment itexpressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face ofa man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the waterthe dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectationof profound thought the round steady hawks eyes looked before himeagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although hismovements were still slow and measuredthe commander of the regiment turned to prince bagration entreatinghim to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they wereplease your excellency for gods sake he kept sayingglancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned awayfrom him there you see and he drew attention to the bulletswhistling singing and hissing continually around them he spoke in thetone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman whohas picked up an ax we are used to it but you sir will blisteryour hands he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him and hishalfclosed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words the staffofficer joined in the colonels appeals but bagration did not replyhe only gave an order to cease firing and reform so as to give roomfor the two approaching battalions while he was speaking the curtainof smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind beganto move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and thehill opposite with the french moving about on it opened out beforethem all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancingagainst them and winding down over the uneven ground one could alreadysee the soldiers shaggy caps distinguish the officers from the menand see the standard flapping against its staffthey march splendidly remarked someone in bagrations suitethe head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clashwould take place on this side of itthe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed upand moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards cametwo battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they hadreached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of men marching instep could be heard on their left flank nearest to bagration marcheda company commander a fine roundfaced man with a stupid and happyexpressionthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at thatmoment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow hewould appear as he passed the commanderwith the selfsatisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly withhis muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his fullheight without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavytread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried closeto his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a realweapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the menwithout losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was asif all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commanderin the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well hewas happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himselfat each alternate step and in time to this with stern but variedfaces the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marchedin step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to berepeating to himself at each alternate step left leftleft a fat major skirted a bush puffing and falling out ofstep a soldier who had fallen behind his face showing alarm at hisdefection ran at a trot panting to catch up with his company a cannonball cleaving the air flew over the heads of bagration and his suiteand fell into the column to the measure of left left closeup came the company commanders voice in jaunty tones thesoldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball hadfallen and an old trooper on the flank a noncommissioned officer whohad stopped beside the dead men ran to catch up his line and fallinginto step with a hop looked back angrily and through the ominoussilence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison oneseemed to hear left left leftwell done lads said prince bagrationglad to do our best your exlenlency came a confused shoutfrom the ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes onbagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say weknow that ourselves another without looking round as thoughfearing to relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed onthe order was given to halt and down knapsacksbagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him anddismounted he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over hisfelt coat stretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of thefrench column with its officers leading appeared from below the hillforward with god said bagration in a resolute sonorous voiceturning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his armshe went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait ofa cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading himforward and experienced great happinessthe french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagrationcould clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even theirfaces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaiteredlegs and turnedout toes climbed the hill with difficulty princebagration gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on infront of the ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from thefrench smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shotssounded several of our men fell among them the roundfaced officerwho had marched so gaily and complacently but at the moment the firstreport was heard bagration looked round and shouted hurrahhurrahahah rang a longdrawn shout from our ranks andpassing bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregularbut joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foechapter xixthe attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our rightflank in the center tushins forgotten battery which had managed toset fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance thefrench were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thusgave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other sideof the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but thedifferent companies did not get mixed but our leftwhich consistedof the azov and podolsk infantry and the pavlograd hussarswassimultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces underlannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkovto the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreatimmediatelyzherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse aboutand galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his couragefailed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it wasdangeroushaving reached the left flank instead of going to the front where thefiring was he began to look for the general and his staff where theycould not possibly be and so did not deliver the orderthe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander ofthe regiment kutuzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dolokhov wasserving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had beenassigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which rostovwas serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were muchexasperated with one another and long after the action had begun onthe right flank and the french were already advancing were engagedin discussion with the sole object of offending one another but theregiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for theimpending action from privates to general they were not expecting abattle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding thehorses and the infantry collecting woodhe higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of thehussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up solet him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars buglersount ze retreatbut haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry minglingtogether thundered on the right and in the center while the capotesof lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam andforming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general incommand of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps andhaving mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to thepavlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but withsecret malevolence in their heartsonce again colonel said the general i cant leave halfmy men in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated tooccupy the position and prepare for an attacki peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your businesssuddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalryi am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and ifyou are not aware of the factquite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the coloneltouching his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be sogoot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i dontvish to destroy my men for your pleasureyou forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasureand i wont allow it to be saidtaking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage thegeneral expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to thefront line as if their differences would be settled there amongst thebullets they reached the front several bullets sped over them andthey halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from theline for from where they had been before it had been evident that itwas impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken groundas well as that the french were outflanking our left the generaland colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like twofighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signsof cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully asthere was nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion forit to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of firethey would have remained there for a long time testing each otherscourage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketryand a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french hadattacked the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possiblefor the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off fromthe line of retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient theposition it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way throughfor themselvesthe squadron in which rostov was serving had scarcely time to mountbefore it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridgethere was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again thatterrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the lineseparating the living from the deadlay between them all wereconscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would crossit or not and how they would cross it agitated them allthe colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions putto him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on havinghis own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumorof an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rangout and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbardsstill no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussarsalike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and thisirresolution communicated itself to the menif only they would be quick thought rostov feeling that at lastthe time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had sooften heard from his fellow hussarsfoward with god lads rang out denisovs voice at atwot fowardthe horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at thereins and started of his own accordbefore him on the right rostov saw the front lines of his hussars andstill farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly buttook to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way offfaster came the word of command and rostov felt rooks flanksdrooping as he broke into a galloprostov anticipated his horses movements and became more and moreelated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had beenin the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand now hehad crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible buteverything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how iwill slash at him thought rostov gripping the hilt of his saberhuraaaah came a roar of voices let anyone come my waynow thought rostov driving his spurs into rook and letting him goat a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy wasalready visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweepover the squadron rostov raised his saber ready to strike but atthat instant the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot awayfrom him and rostov felt as in a dream that he continued to be carriedforward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot frombehind him bondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and lookedangrily at him bondarchuks horse swerved and galloped pasthow is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostovasked and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of afield instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothingbefore him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him therewas warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse iskilled rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning hisriders leg blood was flowing from his head he struggled but couldnot rise rostov also tried to rise but fell back his sabretachehaving become entangled in the saddle where our men were and where thefrench he did not know there was no one nearhaving disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was nowthe line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himselfand could not answer can something bad have happened to mehe wondered as he got up and at that moment he felt that somethingsuperfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as ifit were not his he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to findblood on it ah here are people coming he thought joyfullyseeing some men running toward him they will help me in frontcame a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburnedand with a hooked nose then came two more and many more runningbehind one of them said something strange not in russian in among thehindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar hewas being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind himit must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they willtake me too who are these men thought rostov scarcely believinghis eyes can they be french he looked at the approachingfrenchmen and though but a moment before he had been galloping to getat them and hack them to pieces their proximity now seemed so awfulthat he could not believe his eyes who are they why are theyrunning can they be coming at me and why to kill me me whom everyoneis so fond of he remembered his mothers love for him and hisfamilys and his friends and the enemys intention to kill himseemed impossible but perhaps they may do it for more than tenseconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situationthe foremost frenchman the one with the hooked nose was already soclose that the expression of his face could be seen and the excitedalien face of that man his bayonet hanging down holding his breathand running so lightly frightened rostov he seized his pistol andinstead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran with all hismight toward the bushes he did not now run with the feeling of doubtand conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge but with thefeeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single sentiment thatof fear for his young and happy life possessed his whole being rapidlyleaping the furrows he fled across the field with the impetuosity heused to show at catchplay now and then turning his goodnatured paleyoung face to look back a shudder of terror went through him nobetter not look he thought but having reached the bushes he glancedround once more the french had fallen behind and just as he lookedround the first man changed his run to a walk and turning shoutedsomething loudly to a comrade farther back rostov paused notheres some mistake thought he they cant have wanted tokill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as ifa seventypound weight were tied to it he could run no more thefrenchman also stopped and took aim rostov closed his eyes and stoopeddown one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered hislast remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right andreached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooterschapter xxthe infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirtsof the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed andretreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered thesenseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and thatword infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panicsurrounded cut off were lost shouted the fugitivesthe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the generalrealized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and thethought that he an exemplary officer of many years service whohad never been to blame might be held responsible at headquartersfor negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting therecalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and aboveall quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation heclutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped tothe regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunatelymissed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at anycost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that hean exemplary officer of twentytwo years service who had never beencensured should not be held to blamehaving galloped safely through the french he reached a field behindthe copse across which our men regardless of orders were running anddescending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decidesthe fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiersattend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding himcontinue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seemso terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenancedistorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing ofhis saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into theair and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fateof battles was evidently culminating in a panicthe general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of thepowder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at thatmoment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparentreason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russiansharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timokhinscompany which alone had maintained its order in the wood and havinglain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedlytimokhin armed only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with sucha desperate cry and such mad drunken determination that taken bysurprise the french had thrown down their muskets and run dolokhovrunning beside timokhin killed a frenchman at close quarters and wasthe first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar ourfugitives returned the battalions reformed and the french who hadnearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed ourreserve units were able to join up and the fight was at an end theregimental commander and major ekonomov had stopped beside a bridgeletting the retreating companies pass by them when a soldier came upand took hold of the commanders stirrup almost leaning against himthe man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth he had no knapsackor cap his head was bandaged and over his shoulder a french munitionpouch was slung he had an officers sword in his hand the soldierwas pale his blue eyes looked impudently into the commanders faceand his lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in givinginstructions to major ekonomov he could not help taking notice of thesoldieryour excellency here are two trophies said dolokhov pointingto the french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner istopped the company dolokhov breathed heavily from weariness andspoke in abrupt sentences the whole company can bear witness i begyou will remember this your excellencyall right all right replied the commander and turned to majorekonomovbut dolokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around hishead pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his haira bayonet wound i remained at the front remember yourexcellencytushins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of theaction did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the centersend his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to orderthe battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attachedto tushins battery had been moved away in the middle of the actionby someones order the battery had continued firing and was only notcaptured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyonecould have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefendedguns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led thefrench to suppose that herein the centerthe main russian forceswere concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but oneach occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolatedguns on the hillocksoon after prince bagration had left him tushin had succeeded insetting fire to schon grabernlook at them scurrying its burning just see the smoke finegrand look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymenbrightening upall the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in thedirection of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldierscried at each shot fine thats good look at it grand thefire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columnsthat had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revengefor this failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the villageand began firing them at tushins batteryin their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck insuccessfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed thisbattery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns oneknocking over two horses and another tearing off a munitionwagondrivers leg their spirits once roused were however not diminishedbut only changed character the horses were replaced by others from areserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four gunswere turned against the tengun battery tushins companion officerhad been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hourseventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled butthe artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice theynoticed the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshotat themlittle tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly torefill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from itran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the frenchsmack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by thewheels and working the screws himselfamid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made himjump tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gunnow aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacingdead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in hisfeeble voice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more andmore animated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown andturn away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is alwaysthe case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiersfor the most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in anartillery company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broadas their officerall looked at their commander like children in anembarrassing situation and the expression on his face was invariablyreflected on theirsowing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration andactivity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense offear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded neveroccurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated itseemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since hehad first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the cornerof the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground though hethought of everything considered everything and did everything thebest of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin tofeverish delirium or drunkennessfrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle andthud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiringfaces of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the bloodof men and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys sidealways followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man agun a horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world ofhis own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment affordedhim pleasure the enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipesfrom which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smokerthere hes puffing again muttered tushin to himself as asmall cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left bythe windnow look out for the ball well throw it backwhat do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standingclose by who heard him mutteringnothing only a shell he answeredcome along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery whichwas large and of an old pattern the french swarming round their gunsseemed to him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number oneof the second guns crew was uncle tushin looked at him moreoften than at anyone else and took delight in his every movementthe sound of musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing nowincreasing seemed like someones breathing he listened intently tothe ebb and flow of these sounds daughter of matthewah breathing again breathing he muttered to himselfhe imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwingcannon balls at the french with both handsnow then matvevna dear old lady dont let me down he wassaying as he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice calledabove his head captain tushin captaintushin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turnedhim out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voiceare you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and youwhy are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at hissuperiori dont he muttered holding up two fingers to his capibut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannonball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horsehe paused and just as he was about to say something more another ballstopped him he turned his horse and galloped offretire all to retire he shouted from a distancethe soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the sameorderit was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the spacewhere tushins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with abroken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horsesblood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers layseveral dead men one ball after another passed over as he approachedand he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thoughtof being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought heand dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and didnot leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from theirpositions and withdrawn in his presence together with tushin steppingacross the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attendedto the removal of the gunsa staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said anartilleryman to prince andrew not like your honorprince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seemnot to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannonthat remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hillone shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rodeup to tushinwell till we meet again he said holding out his hand totushingoodby my dear fellow said tushin dear soul goodby mydear fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled hiseyeschapter xxithe wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smokehung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growingdark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous thecannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on theright sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his gunscontinually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of rangeof fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staffamong them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent totushins battery but had never reached it interrupting oneanother they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceedreprimanding and reproaching him tushin gave no orders andsilentlyfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready toweep without knowing whyrode behind on his artillery nag thoughthe orders were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselvesafter troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jauntyinfantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out oftushins wattle shed was laid with a bullet in his stomach onmatvevnas carriage at the foot of the hill a pale hussarcadet supporting one hand with the other came up to tushin and askedfor a seatcaptain for gods sake ive hurt my arm he said timidlyfor gods sake i cant walk for gods sakeit was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift andbeen refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voicetell them to give me a seat for gods sakegive him a seat said tushin lay a cloak for him to sit onlad he said addressing his favorite soldier and where is thewounded officerhe has been set down he died replied someonehelp him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloakantonovthe cadet was rostov with one hand he supported the other he waspale and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed onmatvevna the gun from which they had removed the dead officerthe cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained hisbreeches and armwhat are you wounded my lad said tushin approaching the gunon which rostov satno its a sprainthen what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushinit was the officer your honor stained it answered theartilleryman wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as ifapologizing for the state of his gunit was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by theinfantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted ithad grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten pacesoff and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on theright shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed inthe darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldierswho had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out ofthe village again but tushins guns could not move and theartillerymen tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as theyawaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerlystreamed out of a side streetnot hurt petrov asked oneweve given it em hot mate they wont make another pushnow said anotheryou couldnt see a thing how they shot at their own fellowsnothing could be seen pitchdark brother isnt there something todrinkthe french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again inthe complete darkness tushins guns moved forward surrounded by thehumming infantry as by a framein the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowingalways in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound ofhoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of thewounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darknessof the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with theirgroans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the nightafter a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past ona white horse followed by his suite and said something in passingwhat did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us cameeager questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressingcloser together and a report spread that they were ordered to haltevidently those in front had halted all remained where they were in themiddle of the muddy roadfires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tushinhaving given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressingstation or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire thesoldiers had kindled on the road rostov too dragged himself to thefire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his wholebody drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake byan excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactoryposition he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the firewhich seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble roundshoulderedfigure of tushin who was sitting crosslegged like a turk beside himtushins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy andcommiseration on rostov who saw that tushin with his whole heartwished to help him but could notfrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry whowere walking driving past and settling down all around the soundof voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud thecrackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumbleit was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through thegloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a stormrostov looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before andaround him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels heldhis hands to the blaze and turned away his faceyou dont mind your honor he asked tushin ive lost mycompany your honor i dont know where such bad luckwith the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up tothe bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved atrifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed tothe campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each tryingto snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on toyou picked it up i dare say youre very smart one of themshouted hoarselythen a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained legband came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for watermust one die like a dog said hetushin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldierran up begging a little fire for the infantrya nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellowcountrymen thanks for the firewell return it with interestsaid he carrying away into the darkness a glowing sticknext came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passedby the fire one of them stumbledwho the devil has put the logs on the road snarled hehes deadwhy carry him said anothershut upand they disappeared into the darkness with their loadstill aching tushin asked rostov in a whisperyesyour honor youre wanted by the general he is in the hut heresaid a gunner coming up to tushincoming friendtushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straightwalked away from the firenot far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been preparedfor him prince bagration sat at dinner talking with some commandingofficers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man withthe halfclosed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and thegeneral who had served blamelessly for twentytwo years flushed by aglass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signetring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrewpale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyesin a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french andthe accountant with the naive face was feeling its texture shaking hishead in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested himperhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on ata dinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was afrench colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officerswere flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thanking theindividual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and ourlosses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau wasinforming the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawnfrom the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing thefrench to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions andhad broken up the french troopswhen i saw your excellency that their first battalion wasdisorganized i stopped in the road and thought ill let themcome on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionandthats what i didthe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managedto do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhapsit might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all thatconfusion what did or did not happenby the way your excellency i should inform you hecontinuedremembering dolokhovs conversation with kutuzov and hislast interview with the gentlemanrankerthat private dolokhovwho was reduced to the ranks took a french officer prisoner in mypresence and particularly distinguished himselfi saw the pavlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimedin zherkov looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars allthat day but had heard about them from an infantry officer theybroke up two squares your excellencyseveral of those present smiled at zherkovs words expecting one ofhis usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded tothe glory of our arms and of the days work they assumed a seriousexpression though many of them knew that what he was saying was a liedevoid of any foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonelgentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroicallyinfantry cavalry and artillery how was it that two guns wereabandoned in the center he inquired searching with his eyes forsomeone prince bagration did not ask about the guns on the leftflank he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the verybeginning of the action i think i sent you he added turning tothe staff officer on dutyone was damaged answered the staff officer and the other icant understand i was there all the time giving orders and had onlyjust left it is true that it was hot there he added modestlysomeone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to thevillage and had already been sent foroh but you were there said prince bagration addressing princeandrewof course we only just missed one another said the staffofficer with a smile to bolkonskii had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldlyand abruptlyall were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his waytimidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past thegenerals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by thesight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner andstumbled over it several of those present laughedhow was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not somuch at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkovlaughed loudestonly now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guiltand the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive presentthemselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited thathe had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughterconfused him still more he stood before bagration with his lowerjaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter i dont know yourexcellency i had no men your excellencyyou might have taken some from the covering troopstushin did not say that there were no covering troops though thatwas perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer intotrouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy whohas blundered looks at an examinerthe silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishingto be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture tointervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and hisfingers twitched nervouslyyour excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abruptvoice you were pleased to send me to captain tushins battery iwent there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out twoguns smashed and no supports at allprince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness atbolkonski who spoke with suppressed agitationand if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion hecontinued we owe todays success chiefly to the action of thatbattery and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his companyand without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the tableprince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to showdistrust in bolkonskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fullyto credit it bent his head and told tushin that he could go princeandrew went out with himthank you you saved me my dear fellow said tushinprince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he feltsad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hopedwho are they why are they here what do they want and when willall this end thought rostov looking at the changing shadows beforehim the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistibledrowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and theimpression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness mergedwith the physical pain it was they these soldierswounded andunwoundedit was they who were crushing weighing down and twistingthe sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder torid himself of them he closed his eyesfor a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable thingsappeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white handsonyas thin little shoulders natashas eyes and laughterdenisov with his voice and mustache and telyanin and all that affairwith telyanin and bogdanich that affair was the same thing as thissoldier with the harsh voice and it was that affair and this soldierthat were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing his arm andalways dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from them butthey would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hairs breadthit would not acheit would be wellif only they did not pull it butit was impossible to get rid of themhe opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung lessthan a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow werefluttering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had notcome he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked atthe other side of the fire warming his thin yellow bodynobody wants me thought rostov there is no one to help me orpity me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighedand doing so groaned involuntarilyeh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirtout over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt andadded what a lot of men have been crippled todayfrightfulrostov did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakesfluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warmbright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh hishealthy body and all the affection and care of his family and whydid i come here he wonderednext day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant ofbagrations detachment was reunited to kutuzovs armybook three chapter iprince vasili was not a man who deliberately thought out his plansstill less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage hewas merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on hadbecome a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accountedto himself but which formed the whole interest of his lifewere constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from thecircumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely oneor two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselvessome approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration hedid not for instance say to himself this man now has influence imust gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a specialgrant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i mustentice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rublesi need but when he came across a man of position his instinctimmediately told him that this man could be useful and without anypremeditation prince vasili took the first opportunity to gain hisconfidence flatter him become intimate with him and finally make hisrequesthe had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment asgentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status ofcouncilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him topetersburg and staying at his house with apparent absentmindednessyet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thingprince vasili did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter hadhe thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so naturaland shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody bothabove and below him in social standing something always drew him towardthose richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill inseizing the most opportune moment for making use of peoplepierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezukhov and a rich man felthimself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset andpreoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had tosign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose ofwhich was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit hisestate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did noteven wish to know of his existence but would now have been offendedand grieved had he chosen not to see them these differentpeoplebusinessmen relations and acquaintances alikewere alldisposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flatteringmanner they were all evidently firmly convinced of pierres noblequalities he was always hearing such words as with your remarkablekindness or with your excellent heart you are yourself sohonorable count or were he as clever as you and so ontill he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness andextraordinary intelligence the more so as in the depth of his heart ithad always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligenteven people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidentlyunfriendly now became gentle and affectionate the angry eldestprincess with the long waist and hair plastered down like a dollshad come into pierres room after the funeral with drooping eyesand frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their pastmisunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him foranything except only for permission after the blow she had receivedto remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and whereshe had sacrificed so much she could not refrain from weeping at thesewords touched that this statuesque princess could so change pierretook her hand and begged her forgiveness without knowing what forfrom that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and beganknitting a striped scarf for himdo this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with agreat deal from the deceased said prince vasili to him handing hima deed to sign for the princess benefitprince vasili had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throwthis bonea bill for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princessthat it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair ofthe inlaid portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princessgrew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to himespecially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often madehim feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting himit seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and itwould have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he couldnot but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he hadno time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not hewas always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerfulintoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important andgeneral movement that something was constantly expected of him that ifhe did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if hedid this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded ofhim but still that happy result always remained in the futuremore than anyone else prince vasili took possession of pierresaffairs and of pierre himself in those early days from the death ofcount bezukhov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air ofa man oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not forpitys sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son ofhis old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the capriceof fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent inmoscow after the death of count bezukhov he would call pierre orgo to him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone ofweariness and assurance as if he were adding every time you knowi am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity thati trouble myself about you and you also know quite well that what ipropose is the only thing possiblewell my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said princevasili one day closing his eyes and fingering pierres elbowspeaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreedupon and could not now be altered we start tomorrow and im givingyou a place in my carriage i am very glad all our important businesshere is now settled and i ought to have been off long ago here issomething i have received from the chancellor i asked him for you andyou have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman ofthe bedchamber the diplomatic career now lies open before younotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these wordswere pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his careerwished to make some suggestion but prince vasili interrupted him inthe special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interruptinghis speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion wasneededmais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscienceand there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet ofbeing too much loved and besides you are free you could throw itup tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get topetersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terriblerecollections prince vasili sighed yes yes my boy and myvalet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he addedyou know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle soi have received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep ityou wont require it well go into the accounts laterby what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasili meantseveral thousand rubles quitrent received from pierres peasantswhich the prince had retained for himselfin petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere ofgentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather therank for he did nothing that prince vasili had procured for himand acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerousthat even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustleand continual expectation of some good always in front of him but neverattainedof his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburgthe guards had gone to the front dolokhov had been reduced to theranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrewwas abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as heused to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks witha friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole timewas taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at princevasilis house in the company of the stout princess his wife andhis beautiful daughter helenelike the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change ofattitude toward him that had taken place in societyformerly in anna pavlovnas presence pierre had always felt thatwhat he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable thatremarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind becamefoolish as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary hippolytesstupidest remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre saidwas charmant even if anna pavlovna did not say so he could see thatshe wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modestyin the beginning of the winter of pierre received one of annapavlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was addedyou will find the beautiful helene here whom it is alwaysdelightful to seewhen he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that somelink which other people recognized had grown up between himself andhelene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation werebeing imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as anentertaining suppositionanna pavlovnas at home was like the former one only thenovelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart but adiplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of theemperor alexanders visit to potsdam and of how the two augustfriends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to upholdthe cause of justice against the enemy of the human race anna pavlovnareceived pierre with a shade of melancholy evidently relating to theyoung mans recent loss by the death of count bezukhov everyoneconstantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatlyafflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known and hermelancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mentionof her most august majesty the empress marya fedorovna pierre feltflattered by this anna pavlovna arranged the different groups in herdrawing room with her habitual skill the large group in which wereprince vasili and the generals had the benefit of the diplomatanother group was at the tea table pierre wished to join the formerbut anna pavlovnawho was in the excited condition of a commander ona battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur whichthere is hardly time to put in actionseeing pierre touched hissleeve with her finger sayingwait a bit i have something in view for you this eveningshe glanced at helene and smiled at her my dear helene becharitable to my poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company forten minutes and that it will not be too dull here is the dear countwho will not refuse to accompany youthe beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna detained pierre lookingas if she had to give some final necessary instructionsisnt she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the statelybeauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so younga girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes fromher heart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of menwould occupy a most brilliant position in society dont you think soi only wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna let pierre gopierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to helenesperfection of manner if he ever thought of helene it was just ofher beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified insocietythe old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemeddesirous of hiding her adoration for helene and inclined ratherto show her fear of anna pavlovna she looked at her niece as ifinquiring what she was to do with these people on leaving them annapavlovna again touched pierres sleeve saying i hope you wontsay that it is dull in my house again and she glanced at helenehelene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit thepossibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the auntcoughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to seehelene then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcomeand the same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversationhelene turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gaveto everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so littlemeaning for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was justspeaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierresfather count bezukhov and showed them her own box princess heleneasked to see the portrait of the aunts husband on the box lidthat is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioninga celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take thesnuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other tablehe half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffboxpassing it across helenes back helene stooped forward to makeroom and looked round with a smile she was as always at eveningparties wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low atfront and back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierrewas so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceivethe living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips thathe need only have bent his head a little to have touched them he wasconscious of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and thecreaking of her corset as she moved he did not see her marble beautyforming a complete whole with her dress but all the charm of her bodyonly covered by her garments and having once seen this he could nothelp being aware of it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have onceseen throughso you have never noticed before how beautiful i am heleneseemed to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am awoman who may belong to anyoneto you too said her glance and atthat moment pierre felt that helene not only could but must be hiswife and that it could not be otherwisehe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at thealtar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did noteven know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not whythat it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happenpierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to seeher as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her everyday until then but he could no longer do it he could not any morethan a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through themist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he hasonce recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to himshe already had power over him and between them there was no longer anybarrier except the barrier of his own willwell i will leave you in your little corner came annapavlovnas voice i see you are all right thereand pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anythingreprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyoneknew what had happened to him as he knew it himselfa little later when he went up to the large circle anna pavlovna saidto him i hear you are refitting your petersburg housethis was true the architect had told him that it was necessary andpierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg housedone upthats a good thing but dont move from prince vasilis itis good to have a friend like the prince she said smiling at princevasili i know something about that dont i and you are still soyoung you need advice dont be angry with me for exercising an oldwomans privilegeshe paused as women always do expecting something after they havementioned their age if you marry it will be a different thingshe continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look athelene nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him hemuttered something and coloredwhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of whathad happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood thatthe woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentionedhe had said absentmindedly yes shes good looking he hadunderstood that this woman might belong to himbut shes stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thoughtthere is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excitesin me i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with herand she with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats whyhe was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is herfather its bad he reflected but while he was thinking thisthe reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and wasconscious that another line of thought had sprung up and while thinkingof her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be hiswife how she would love him become quite different and how all he hadthought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as thedaughter of prince vasili but visualized her whole body only veiledby its gray dress but no why did this thought never occur to mebefore and again he told himself that it was impossible that therewould be something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable inthis marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the wordsand looks of those who had seen them together he recalled annapavlovnas words and looks when she spoke to him about his houserecalled thousands of such hints from prince vasili and others and wasseized by terror lest he had already in some way bound himself to dosomething that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but atthe very time he was expressing this conviction to himself in anotherpart of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beautychapter iiin november prince vasili had to go on a tour of inspectionin four different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as tovisit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatolewhere his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholasbolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of thatrich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairsprince vasili had to settle matters with pierre who it is true hadlatterly spent whole days at home that is in prince vasilis housewhere he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish inhelenes presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposedto herthis is all very fine but things must be settled said princevasili to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling thatpierre who was under such obligations to him but never mind thatwas not behaving very well in this matter youth frivolity wellgod be with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heartbut it must be brought to a head the day after tomorrow will belelyas name day i will invite two or three people and if he doesnot understand what he ought to do then it will be my affairyes myaffair i am her fathersix weeks after anna pavlovnas at home and after the sleeplessnight when he had decided that to marry helene would be a calamity andthat he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decisionhad not left prince vasilis and felt with terror that in peopleseyes he was every day more and more connected with her that it wasimpossible for him to return to his former conception of her that hecould not break away from her and that though it would be a terriblething he would have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps havebeen able to free himself but that prince vasili who had rarely beforegiven receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an eveningparty at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoilthe general pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation princevasili in the rare moments when he was at home would take pierreshand in passing and draw it downwards or absentmindedly hold out hiswrinkled cleanshaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say tilltomorrow or be in to dinner or i shall not see you or iam staying in for your sake and so on and though prince vasiliwhen he stayed in as he said for pierres sake hardly exchanged acouple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint himevery day he said to himself one and the same thing it is time iunderstood her and made up my mind what she really is was i mistakenbefore or am i mistaken now no she is not stupid she is an excellentgirl he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistakenever says anything stupid she says little but what she does say isalways clear and simple so she is not stupid she never was abashed andis not abashed now so she cannot be a bad woman he had often begunto make reflections or think aloud in her company and she had alwaysanswered him either by a brief but appropriate remarkshowing that itdid not interest heror by a silent look and smile which more palpablythan anything else showed pierre her superiority she was right inregarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smileshe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for himalone in which there was something more significant than in the generalsmile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone waswaiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew thatsooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terrorseized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times duringthat month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer tothat dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i needresolution can it be that i have nonehe wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matterhe lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and reallypossessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feelthemselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpoweredby a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at annapavlovnas an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desireparalyzed his willon helenes name day a small party of just their own peopleashis wife saidmet for supper at prince vasilis all these friendsand relations had been given to understand that the fate of the younggirl would be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supperprincess kuragina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsomewas sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat themore important guestsan old general and his wife and anna pavlovnascherer at the other end sat the younger and less important guestsand there too sat the members of the family and pierre and heleneside by side prince vasili was not having any supper he went roundthe table in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another ofthe guests to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remarkexcept to pierre and helene whose presence he seemed not to noticehe enlivened the whole party the wax candles burned brightly thesilver and crystal gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the goldand silver of the mens epaulets servants in scarlet liveries movedround the table the clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled withthe animated hum of several conversations at one end of the table theold chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved herpassionately at which she laughed at the other could be heard thestory of the misfortunes of some mary viktorovna or other at thecenter of the table prince vasili attracted everybodys attentionwith a facetious smile on his face he was telling the ladies about lastwednesdays meeting of the imperial council at which sergey kuzmichvyazmitinov the new military governor general of petersburg hadreceived and read the then famous rescript of the emperor alexanderfrom the army to sergey kuzmich in which the emperor said that he wasreceiving from all sides declarations of the peoples loyalty thatthe declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure and thathe was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to beworthy of it this rescript began with the words sergey kuzmichfrom all sides reports reach me etcwell and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmichasked one of the ladiesexactly not a hairs breadth farther answered prince vasililaughing sergey kuzmich from all sides from all sidessergey kuzmich poor vyazmitinov could not get any fartherhe began the rescript again and again but as soon as he utteredsergey he sobbed kuzmich tears and from allsides was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther and againhis handkerchief and again sergey kuzmich from all sidesand tears till at last somebody else was asked to read itkuzmich from all sides and then tears someone repeatedlaughingdont be unkind cried anna pavlovna from her end of the tableholding up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellentman our dear vyazmitinoveverybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where thehonored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under theinfluence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre andhelene sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table asuppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothingto do with sergey kuzmicha smile of bashfulness at their ownfeelings but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked muchas they enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however theyavoided looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant asthey seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gavethat the story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the foodwere all a pretense and that the whole attention of that company wasdirected topierre and helene prince vasili mimicked the sobbingof sergey kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward hisdaughter and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly saidyes its getting on it will all be settled today annapavlovna threatened him on behalf of our dear vyazmitinov andin her eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasiliread a congratulation on his future soninlaw and on his daughtershappiness the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to theold lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter and her sighseemed to say yes theres nothing left for you and me but to sipsweet wine my dear now that the time has come for these young ones tobe thus boldly provocatively happy and what nonsense all this isthat i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy facesof the lovers thats happinessinto the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting thatsociety had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthyand handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feelingdominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatterjests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation wasevidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting attable seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they lookedat the beautiful helene with her radiant face and at the red broadand happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very lightof the candles was focused on those two happy faces alonepierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased andembarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupationhe did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now andthen detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shotunexpectedly through his mindso it is all finished he thought and how has it all happenedhow quickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myselfalone but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they areall expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot icannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but itwill certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzlingshoulders close to his eyesor he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt itawkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered alucky man and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of parispossessed of a helen but no doubt it always is and must be sohe consoled himself and besides what have i done to bring it abouthow did it begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasili then therewas nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cardswith her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did itbegin when did it all come about and here he was sitting by herside as her betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness herbreathing her movements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to himthat it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that waswhy they all looked so at him and flattered by this general admirationhe would expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his goodfortune suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him asecond time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand whatwas saidi am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski repeatedprince vasili a third time how absentminded you are my dearfellowprince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling athim and helene well what of it if you all know it thoughtpierre what of it its the truth and he himself smiled hisgentle childlike smile and helene smiled toowhen did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeatedprince vasili who pretended to want to know this in order to settle adisputehow can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierreyes from olmutz he answered with a sighafter supper pierre with his partner followed the others into thedrawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leaveof helene some as if unwilling to distract her from an importantoccupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go awayrefusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournfulsilence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of hisdiplomatic career in comparison with pierres happiness the oldgeneral grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh theold fool he thought that princess helene will be beautifulstill when shes fiftyi think i may congratulate you whispered anna pavlovna to theold princess kissing her soundly if i hadnt this headache idhave stayed longerthe old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of herdaughters happinesswhile the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long timealone with helene in the little drawing room where they were sittinghe had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with herbut had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitablebut he could not make up his mind to take the final step he feltashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place herebeside helene this happiness is not for you some inner voicewhispered to him this happiness is for those who have not in themwhat there is in youbut as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she wassatisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner thatthis name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever hadsome of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting inthe large drawing room prince vasili came up to pierre with languidfootsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasili gavehim a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said wasso strange that one could not take it in but then the expression ofseverity changed and he drew pierres hand downwards made him sitdown and smiled affectionatelywell lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter andaddressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural toparents who have petted their children from babyhood but which princevasili had only acquired by imitating other parentsand he again turned to pierresergey kuzmichfrom all sides he said unbuttoning the topbutton of his waistcoatpierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the storyabout sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasili just then andprince vasili saw that pierre knew this he suddenly mutteredsomething and went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince wasdisconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the worldtouched pierre he looked at helene and she too seemed disconcertedand her look seemed to say well it is your own faultthe step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierreand he again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergeykuzmich asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard itproperly helene answered with a smile that she too had missed itwhen prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess hiswife was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierreof course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dearmarriages are made in heaven replied the elderly ladyprince vasili passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat downon a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed tobe dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himselfaline he said to his wife go and see what they are aboutthe princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified andindifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre andhelene still sat talking just as beforestill the same she said to her husbandprince vasili frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and hisface assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shakinghimself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps wentpast the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he wentjoyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierrerose in alarm on seeing itthank god said prince vasili my wife has told meeverything he put one arm around pierre and the other around hisdaughtermy dear boy lelya i am very pleased hisvoice trembled i loved your father and she will make you a goodwife god bless youhe embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with hismalodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeksprincess come here he shoutedthe old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was usingher handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautifulhelenes hand several times after a while they were left aloneagainall this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierreso it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good becauseits definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierreheld the hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautifulbosom as it rose and fellhelene he said aloud and pausedsomething special is always said in such cases he thought butcould not remember what it was that people say he looked at her faceshe drew nearer to him her face flushedoh take those off those she said pointing to hisspectaclespierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes havefrom which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened andinquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it butwith a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted hislips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its alteredunpleasantly excited expressionit is too late now its done besides i love her thoughtpierreje vous aime he said remembering what has to be said at suchmoments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself i love yousix weeks later he was married and settled in count bezukhovslarge newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as peoplesaid of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of moneychapter iiiold prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from prince vasiliin november announcing that he and his son would be paying hima visit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course ishall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you atthe same time my honored benefactor wrote prince vasili my sonanatole is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you willallow him personally to express the deep respect that emulating hisfather he feels for youit seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors arecoming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the littleprincess on hearing the newsprince nicholas frowned but said nothinga fortnight after the letter prince vasilis servants came oneevening in advance of him and he and his son arrived next dayold bolkonski had always had a poor opinion of prince vasilischaracter but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul andalexander prince vasili had risen to high position and honors and nowfrom the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princesshe saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed intoa feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentionedhim on the day of prince vasilis arrival prince bolkonski wasparticularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a badtemper because prince vasili was coming or whether his being in a badtemper made him specially annoyed at prince vasilis visit he wasin a bad temper and in the morning tikhon had already advised thearchitect not to go to the prince with his reportdo you hear how hes walking said tikhon drawing thearchitects attention to the sound of the princes footstepsstepping flat on his heelswe know what that meanshowever at nine oclock the prince in his velvet coat with a sablecollar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the daybefore and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in thehabit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were stillvisible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of thesoft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince wentthrough the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildingsfrowning and silentcan a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable manresembling his master in manners and looks who was accompanying himback to the housethe snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honorthe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god bethanked thought the overseer the storm has blown overit would have been hard to drive up your honor he added iheard your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honorthe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on himfrowningwhat a minister what minister who gave orders he said inhis shrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess mydaughter but for a minister for me there are no ministersyour honor i thoughtyou thought shouted the prince his words coming more and morerapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackguardsill teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it andwould have hit alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctivelyavoided the blow thought blackguards shouted the princerapidlybut although alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding thestroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly beforehim or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continuedto shout blackguards throw the snow back on the road did notlift his stick again but hurried into the housebefore dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knewthat the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoisellebourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am thesame as usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcasteyes what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasionsshe ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could notshe thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do notsympathize with him if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he willsay as he has done before that im in the dumpsthe prince looked at his daughters frightened face and snortedfool or dummy he mutteredand the other one is not here theyve been telling tales hethoughtreferring to the little princess who was not in the diningroomwhere is the princess he asked hidingshe is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne witha bright smile so she wont come down it is natural in herstatehm hm muttered the prince sitting downhis plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot heflung it away tikhon caught it and handed it to a footman the littleprincess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the princethat hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appeari am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienneheaven knows what a fright might doin general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear andwith a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did notrealize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the princereciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contemptfor her when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at baldhills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent wholedays with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with herabout the old prince and criticized himso we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoisellebourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers hisexcellency prince vasili kuragin and his son i understand shesaid inquiringlyhmhis excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in theservice said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming

morningno mon perethough mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choiceof a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about theconservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened andafter the soup the prince became more genialafter dinner he went to see his daughterinlaw the little princesswas sitting at a small table chattering with masha her maid she grewpale on seeing her fatherinlawshe was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheekshad sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn downyes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to theprinces question as to how she feltdo you want anythingno merci mon perewell all right all righthe left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood withbowed headhas the snow been shoveled backyes your excellency forgive me for heavens sake it was onlymy stupidityall right all right interrupted the prince and laughing hisunnatural way he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and thenproceeded to his studyprince vasili arrived that evening he was met in the avenue bycoachmen and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up toone of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snowprince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to themanatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before atable on a corner of which he smilingly and absentmindedly fixed hislarge and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual roundof amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for himand he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and uglyheiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very welland amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much moneythat never does any harm thought anatolehe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which hadbecome habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered hisfathers room with the goodhumored and victorious air natural tohim prince vasilis two valets were busy dressing him and he lookedround with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latterentered as if to say yes thats how i want you to looki say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole askedas if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often beenmentioned during the journeyenough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautiouswith the old princeif he starts a row ill go away said prince anatole icant bear those old men ehremember for you everything depends on thisin the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms thatthe minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both hadbeen minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her roomvainly trying to master her agitationwhy did they write why did lise tell me about it it can neverhappen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall ienter the drawing room even if i like him i cant now be myself withhim the mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terrorthe little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already receivedfrom masha the ladys maid the necessary report of how handsome theministers son was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and withwhat difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the sonhad followed him like an eagle three steps at a time having receivedthis information the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whosechattering voices had reached her from the corridor went into princessmarys roomyou know theyve come marie said the little princess waddlingin and sinking heavily into an armchairshe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morningbut had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and herface was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and fadedoutlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was stillmore noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touchhad been added to mademoiselle bouriennes toilet which rendered herfresh and pretty face yet more attractivewhat are you going to remain as you are dear princess shebegan theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawingroom and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourselfup at allthe little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrilybegan to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should bedressed princess marys selfesteem was wounded by the fact thatthe arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by bothher companions not having the least conception that it could beotherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for themwould be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers todress her would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed herbeautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it tookon the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore as shesubmitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these womenquite sincerely tried to make her look pretty she was so plain thatneither of them could think of her as a rival so they began dressingher with perfect sincerity and with the naive and firm convictionwomen have that dress can make a face prettyno really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise lookingsideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroondress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life maybe at stake but this one is too light its not becomingit was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess marythat was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the littleprincess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placedin the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower onthe best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot thatthe frightened face and the figure could not be altered and thathowever they might change the setting and adornment of that face itwould still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes towhich princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arrangedon the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled herlooks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue scarf thelittle princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of thedress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at herwith her head bent first on one side and then on the otherno it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands nomary really this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your littlegray everyday dress now please do it for my sake katie she saidto the maid bring the princess her gray dress and youll seemademoiselle bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smilingwith a foretaste of artistic pleasurebut when katie brought the required dress princess mary remainedsitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in themirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burstinto sobscome dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one morelittle effortthe little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princessmarywell now well arrange something quite simple and becoming shesaidthe three voices hers mademoiselle bouriennes and katies whowas laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirpingof birdsno leave me alone said princess maryher voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birdswas silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtfuleyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly atthem and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insistat least change your coiffure said the little princessdidnt i tell you she went on turning reproachfully tomademoiselle bourienne marys is a face which such a coiffure doesnot suit in the least not in the least please change itleave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same tome answered a voice struggling with tearsmademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselvesthat princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usualbut it was too late she was looking at them with an expression theyboth knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princessmary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but theyknew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not tobe shaken in her determinationyou will change it wont you said lise and as princess marygave no answer she left the roomprincess mary was left alone she did not comply with lises requestshe not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in herglass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes andpondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractivebeing rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally differenthappy world of his own she fancied a child her ownsuch as she hadseen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughterat herown breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and thechild but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thoughtplease come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came themaids voice at the doorshe roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking andbefore going down she went into the room where the icons hung and hereyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by alamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painfuldoubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for aman be for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed ofhappiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longingwas for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling fromothers and even from herself the stronger it grew o god shesaid how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devilhow am i to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully tofulfill thy will and scarcely had she put that question than godgave her the answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyselfseek nothing be not anxious or envious mans future and thy own fatemust remain hidden from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready foranything if it be gods will to prove thee in the duties of marriagebe ready to fulfill his will with this consoling thought butyet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longingprincess mary sighed and having crossed herself went down thinkingneither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of whatshe would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will ofgod without whose care not a hair of mans head can fallchapter ivwhen princess mary came down prince vasili and his son were alreadyin the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoisellebourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heelsthe gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princessindicating her to the gentlemen said voila marie princess marysaw them all and saw them in detail she saw prince vasilis faceserious for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smilingagain and the little princess curiously noting the impressionmarie produced on the visitors and she saw mademoisellebourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her unusually animatedlook which was fixed on him but him she could not see she only sawsomething large brilliant and handsome moving toward her as sheentered the room prince vasili approached first and she kissed thebold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question bysaying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well thenanatole came up to her she still could not see him she only felt asoft hand taking hers firmly and she touched with her lips a whiteforehead over which was beautiful lightbrown hair smelling of pomadewhen she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty anatole stoodwith his right thumb under a button of his uniform his chest expandedand his back drawn in slightly swinging one foot and with his head alittle bent looked with beaming face at the princess withoutspeaking and evidently not thinking about her at all anatole was notquickwitted nor ready or eloquent in conversation but he had thefaculty so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbableselfpossession if a man lacking in selfconfidence remains dumb ona first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety ofsuch silence and an anxiety to find something to say the effect isbad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly examined theprincess hair it was evident that he could be silent in this way fora very long time if anyone finds this silence inconvenient let himtalk but i dont want to he seemed to say besides this in hisbehavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires inthem curiosity awe and even lovea supercilious consciousness ofhis own superiority it was as if he said to them i know you i knowyou but why should i bother about you youd be only too glad ofcourse perhaps he did not really think this when he met womenevenprobably he did not for in general he thought very littlebut hislooks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and as ifwishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest himshe turned to his father the conversation was general and animatedthanks to princess lises voice and little downy lip that lifted overher white teeth she met prince vasili with that playful manner oftenemployed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumptionthat between the person they so address and themselves there are somesemiprivate longestablished jokes and amusing reminiscences thoughno such reminiscences really existjust as none existed in this caseprince vasili readily adopted her tone and the little princess alsodrew anatole whom she hardly knew into these amusing recollections ofthings that had never occurred mademoiselle bourienne also shared themand even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in thesemerry reminiscenceshere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all toourselves dear prince said the little princess of course infrench to prince vasili its not as at annettes receptionswhere you always ran away you remember cette chere annette anna pavlovnaah but you wont talk politics to me like annetteand our little tea tableoh yeswhy is it you were never at annettes the little princess askedanatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance yourbrother hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook herfinger at him i have even heard of your doings in parisand didnt hippolyte tell you asked prince vasili turning tohis son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have runaway and he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you howhe himself was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him thedoor oh she is a pearl among women princess he added turning toprincess marywhen paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized theopportunity of joining in the general current of recollectionsshe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatolehad left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered thefrenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to herabout her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatolecame to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull eithernot at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad thatlittle companion i hope she will bring her along with her when weremarried la petite est gentille the little one is charmingthe old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and consideringwhat he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what areprince vasili and that son of his to me prince vasili is a shallowbraggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled tohimself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revivedin his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one aboutwhich he always deceived himself the question was whether he could everbring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband theprince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehandthat he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not onlywith his feelings but with the very possibility of life life withoutprincess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable tohim and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy forcertain theres lise married to andrewa better husband one wouldthink could hardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with herlot and who would marry marie for love plain and awkward theylltake her for her connections and wealth are there no women livingunmarried and even the happier for it so thought prince bolkonskiwhile dressing and yet the question he was always putting off demandedan immediate answer prince vasili had brought his son with the evidentintention of proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably askfor an answer his birth and position in society were not bad wellive nothing against it the prince said to himself but he mustbe worthy of her and that is what we shall seethat is what we shall see that is what we shall see he addedaloudhe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidlyround the company he noticed the change in the little princessdress mademoiselle bouriennes ribbon princess marys unbecomingcoiffure mademoiselle bouriennes and anatoles smiles and theloneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation got herselfup like a fool he thought looking irritably at her she isshameless and he ignores herhe went

and perfectcomposure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father hadtold him to expectprince bolkonski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofaand drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to it and beganquestioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listenattentively to what prince vasili said but kept glancing at princessmaryand so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeatingprince vasilis last words then rising he suddenly went up to hisdaughteris it for visitors youve got yourself up like that eh saidhe fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way forthe visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you arenever to dare to change your way of dress without my consentit was my fault mon pere interceded

no more attention to his daughter who wasreduced to tearson the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well saidprince vasilinow you young prince whats your name said prince bolkonskiturning

youknow my principleseverything aboveboard i will ask her tomorrow inyour presence if she is willing then he can stay on he can stay andill see the old prince snorted let her marry its all thesame to me he screamed in the same piercing tone as when partingfrom his soni will tell you frankly said prince vasili in the tone ofa crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with sokeensighted a companion you know you see right through peopleanatole is no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellentson or kinsmanall right all right well seeas always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of timewithout male society on anatoles appearance all the three women ofprince bolkonskis household felt that their life had not been realtill then their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediatelyincreased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed indarkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significanceprincess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure thehandsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbedall her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly andmagnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a futurefamily life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away andtried to conceal thembut am i not too cold with him thought the princess i tryto be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to himalready but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imaginethat i do not like himand princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her newguest poor girl shes devilish ugly thought anatolemademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by anatolesarrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young womanwithout any definite position without relations or even a country didnot intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkonski to readingaloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoisellebourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able toappreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressedungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry heroff and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knewa story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which sheliked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had beenseduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared andreproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoisellebourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told thisstory to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince hadappeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appearand he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoisellebouriennes head at the very time she was talking to anatole aboutparis it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for amoment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiarto her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself aroundhim and she wished and tried to please him as much as possiblethe little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpetunconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for thefamiliar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or anystruggle but with naive and lighthearted gaietyalthough in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a mantired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by thespectacle of his power over these three women besides that he wasbeginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bouriennethat passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with greatsuddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actionsafter tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary wasasked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spiritscame and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoisellebourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotionher favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world andthe look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic butanatoles expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred notto her but to the movements of mademoiselle bouriennes littlefoot which he was then touching with his own under the clavichordmademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess mary and in herlovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also newto the princesshow she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am nowand how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husbandcan it be possible she thought not daring to look at his face butstill feeling his eyes gazing at herin the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatolekissed princess marys hand she did not know how she found thecourage but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came nearto her shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up andkissed mademoiselle bouriennes hand this was not etiquette butthen he did everything so simply and with such assurance mademoisellebourienne flushed and gave the princess a frightened lookwhat delicacy thought the princess is it possible thatamelie mademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of herand not value her pure affection and devotion to me she went upto her and kissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the littleprincess handno no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behavingwell i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said andsmilingly raising a finger at him she left the roomchapter vthey all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as hegot into bed all kept awake a long time that nightis he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kindyeskind that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear whichshe had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round itseemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in thedark corner and this someone was hethe deviland he was also thisman with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lipsshe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her roommademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a longtime that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone nowworking herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mererebuking her for her fallthe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly madeshe could not lie either on her face or on her side every position wasawkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more thanever because anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the timewhen she was not like that and when everything was light and gay shesat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepyand disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the thirdtime muttering to herselfi told you it was all lumps and holes the little princessrepeated i should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not myfault and her voice quivered like that of a child about to crythe old prince did not sleep either tikhon half asleep heard himpacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though hehad been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointedbecause it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom heloved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would considerthe whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act butinstead of that he only excited himself more and morethe first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everythingelse runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlikeherself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should noticeit fr fr fr and dont i see that that idiot had eyes only forbouriennei shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has notpride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might atleast have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinksnothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride butill let her seethe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making amistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienneprincess marys selfesteem would be wounded and his point not tobe parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with thisthought he called tikhon and began to undresswhat devil brought them here thought he while tikhon wasputting the nightshirt over his driedup old body and grayhaired chesti never invited them they came to disturb my lifeand there is notmuch of it leftdevil take em he muttered while his head was still covered bythe shirttikhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud andtherefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression ofthe face that emerged from the shirtgone to bed asked the princetikhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of hismasters thoughts he guessed that the question referred to princevasili and his sonthey have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellencyno good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting hisfeet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressinggown he went to the couch on which he sleptthough no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bouriennethey quite understood one another as to the first part of their romanceup to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they hadmuch to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking anopportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess marywent to her fathers room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienneand anatole met in the conservatoryprincess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidationit seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would bedecided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it sheread this in tikhons face and in that of prince vasilis valetwho made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hotwaterthe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment ofhis daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstakingexpression of her fathers his face wore that expression when hisdry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum inarithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from herrepeating in a low voice the same words several times overhe came to the point at once treating her ceremoniouslyi have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with anunnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vasili hasnot come and brought his pupil with him for some reason princebolkonski referred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of mybeautiful eyes last night a proposition was made me on your accountand as you know my principles i refer it to youhow am i to

never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gazeunder which she felt that she could not think but would only be able tosubmit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but ifi had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the oldprince interrupted herthats admirable he shouted he will take you with yourdowry and take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain shell be thewife while youthe prince stopped he saw the effect these words had produced on hisdaughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tearsnow then now then im only joking he said remember

thestudyher fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had saidabout mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure butstill it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she wasgoing straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearinganything when suddenly the wellknown whispering of mademoisellebourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away sawanatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her witha horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princessmary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoisellebourienne who had not yet seen herwhos that why wait a moment anatoles face seemed to sayprincess mary looked at them in silence she could not understand it atlast mademoiselle

madam said the nineyearold petyawith the air of an old brigadierthe countess had been prepared by anna mikhaylovnas hints at dinneron retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on aminiature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tearskept coming into her eyes anna mikhaylovna with the letter came ontiptoe to the countess door and pauseddont come in she said to the old count who was following hercome later and she went in closing the door behind herthe count put his ear to the keyhole and listenedat first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then annamikhaylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silencethen both voices together with glad intonations and then footstepsanna mikhaylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expressionof a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits thepublic to appreciate his skillit is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to thecountess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait andin the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lipswhen she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced hisbald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portraitand in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed awaythe bald head vera natasha sonya and petya now entered the roomand the reading of the letter began after a brief description ofthe campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and hispromotion nicholas said that he kissed his fathers and mothershands asking for their blessing and that he kissed vera natasha andpetya besides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madameschoss and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dearsonya whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever when sheheard this sonya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unableto bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hallwhirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloonand flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor the countess wascryingwhy are you crying mamma asked vera from all he says oneshould be glad and not crythis was quite true but the count the countess and natasha lookedat her reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought thecountessnicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who wereconsidered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for shedid not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses anddmitri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the lettereach time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it freshproofs of nikolenkas virtues how strange how extraordinary howjoyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whosetiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whomshe used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son whohad first learned to say pear and then granny that this sonshould now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manlywarrior doing some kind of mans work of his own without help orguidance the universal experience of ages showing that children dogrow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for thecountess her sons growth toward manhood at each of its stageshad seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed themillions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twentyyears before it seemed impossible that the little creature who livedsomewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin tospeak so now she could not believe that that little creature could bethis strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by thisletter he now waswhat a style how charmingly he describes said she reading thedescriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word abouthimself not a word about some denisov or other though he himselfi dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about hissufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has rememberedeverybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only sohighi always saidfor more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts ofletters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied outwhile under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of thecount money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipmentof the newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikhaylovnapractical woman that she was had even managed by favor with armyauthorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herselfand her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grandduke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards the rostovssupposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite addressand that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guardsthere was no reason why it should not reach the pavlograd regimentwhich was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it wasdecided to send the letters and money by the grand dukes courier toboris and boris was to forward them to nicholas the letters were fromthe old count the countess petya vera natasha and sonya andfinally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various otherthings the old count sent to his sonchapter viion the twelfth of november

all the way in step a practice onwhich the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at theirproper posts boris had been quartered and had marched all theway with berg who was already in command of a company berg who hadobtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence ofhis superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his moneymatters very satisfactorily boris during the campaign had made theacquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and bya letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had becomeacquainted with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he hoped toobtain a post on the commander in chiefs staff berg and borishaving rested after yesterdays march were sitting clean and neatlydressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to themplaying chess berg held a smoking pipe between his knees boris inthe accurate way characteristic of him was building a little pyramid ofchessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting bergs moveand watched his opponents face evidently thinking about the game ashe always thought only of whatever he was engaged onwell how are you going to get out of that he remarkedwell try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removinghis handat that moment the door openedhere he is at last shouted rostov and berg too oh youpetisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russiannurses french at which he and boris used to laugh long agodear me how you have changedboris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady andreplace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace hisfriend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youththat dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a mannerdifferent from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholaswished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinchhim push him do anything but kiss hima thing everybody did butnotwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way andkissed him three timesthey had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when youngmen take their first steps on lifes road each saw immense changes inthe other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had takenthose first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and bothwere in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in themoh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if youd been to a fetenot like us sinners of the line cried rostov with martial swaggerand with baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his ownmudbespattered breeches the german landlady hearing rostovs loudvoice popped her head in at the dooreh is she pretty he asked with a winkwhy do you shout so youll frighten them said boris i didnot expect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterdayby bolkonskian adjutant of kutuzovs whos a friend of minei did not think he would get it to you so quickly well how are youbeen under fire already asked boriswithout answering rostov shook the soldiers cross of st georgefastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged armglanced at berg with a smileas you see he saidindeed yes yes said boris with a smile and we too havehad a splendid march you know of course that his imperial highnessrode with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort andevery advantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners andballs i cant tell you and the tsarevich was very gracious to allour officersand the two friends told each other of their doings the one of hishussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasuresand advantages of service under members of the imperial familyoh you guards said rostov i say send for some wineboris made a grimaceif you really want it said hehe went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sentfor wineyes and i have some money and a letter to give you he addedrostov took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put botharms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines heglanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind theletterwell theyve sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavypurse that sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on ourpay i can tell you for myselfi say berg my dear fellow said rostov when you get aletter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talkeverything over with and i happen to be there ill go at once tobe out of your way do go somewhere anywhere to the devil heexclaimed and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and lookingamiably into his face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of hiswords he added dont be hurt my dear fellow you know i speakfrom my heart as to an old acquaintanceoh dont mention it count i quite understand said berggetting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voicego across to our hosts they invited you added borisberg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of duststood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his templesupwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and havingassured himself from the way rostov looked at it that his coat had beennoticed left the room with a pleasant smileoh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read theletterwhyoh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given themsuch a fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenlywell have you sent gabriel for some wine all right lets havesomein the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendationto bagration which the old countess at anna mikhaylovnas advice hadobtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to takeit to its destination and make use of itwhat nonsense much i need it said rostov throwing the letterunder the tablewhy have you thrown that away asked borisit is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want itforwhy what the devil said boris picking it up and readingthe address this letter would be of great use to youi want nothing and i wont be anyones adjutantwhy not inquired borisits a lackeys jobyou are still the same dreamer i see remarked boris shakinghis headand youre still the same diplomatist but thats not thepoint come how are you asked rostovwell as you see so far everythings all right but i confess ishould much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the frontwhybecause when once a man starts on military service he should try tomake as successful a career of it as possibleoh thats it said rostov evidently thinking of somethingelsehe looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidentlytrying in vain to find the answer to some questionold gabriel brought in the wineshouldnt we now send for berg asked boris he would drinkwith you i cantwell send for him and how do you get on with that germanasked rostov with a contemptuous smilehe is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answeredborisagain rostov looked intently into boris eyes and sighed bergreturned and over the bottle of wine conversation between the threeofficers became animated the guardsmen told rostov of their march andhow they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spokeof the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and toldstories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silentwhen the subject did not relate to himself but in connection with thestories of the grand dukes quick temper he related with gusto how ingalicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the lattermade a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity ofa movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand dukehad ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting arnautsarnauts was the tsarevichs favorite expression when he was ina rage and called for the company commanderwould you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knewi was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the armyorders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lordsprayer so count there never is any negligence in my company andso my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up andshowed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and reallyit would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect andselfcomplacency than his did well he stormed at me as the sayingis stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life butrather of death as the saying is albanians and devilsand to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew iwas in the right so i kept silent was not that best count heyare you dumb he shouted still i remained silent and what do youthink count the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders ofthe day thats what keeping ones head means thats the waycount said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smokeyes that was fine said rostov smilingbut boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg andskillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and wherehe got his wound this pleased rostov and he began talking about itand as he went on became more and more animated he told them of hisschon grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battlegenerally do describe it that is as they would like it to have beenas they have heard it described by others and as sounds well but notat all as it really was rostov was a truthful young man and would onno account have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning totell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarilyand inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to hishearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and hadformed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hearjust such a storythey would either not have believed him or stillworse would have thought that rostov was himself to blame since whatgenerally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happenedto him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot andthat he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard ashe could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything asit really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort ofwill to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truthand young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a storyof how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown likea storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how hissaber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so hetold them all thatin the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imaginewhat a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack princeandrew whom boris was expecting entered the room prince andrew wholiked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistanceand being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him theday before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sentwith papers from kutuzov to the tsarevich he looked in on borishoping to find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the linerecounting his military exploits prince andrew could not endurethat sort of man he gave boris a pleasant smile frowned as withhalfclosed eyes he looked at rostov bowed slightly and wearily andsat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have droppedin on bad company rostov flushed up on noticing this but he did notcare this was a mere stranger glancing however at boris he sawthat he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the linein spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite ofthe contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of viewregarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomerwas evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silentboris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what withoutindiscretion one might ask about our planswe shall probably advance replied bolkonski evidently reluctantto say more in the presence of a strangerberg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as wasrumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would bedoubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he couldgive no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughedgailyas to your business prince andrew continued addressing boriswe will talk of it later and he looked round at rostov cometo me after the review and we will do what is possibleand having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostovwhose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing toanger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you weretalking of the schon grabern affair were you therei was there said rostov angrily as if intending to insult theaidedecampbolkonski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him witha slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many storiesnow told about that affairyes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenlygrown furious now at boris now at bolkonski yes many storiesbut our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemysfire our stories have some weight not like the stories of thosefellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anythingof whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quietand particularly amiable smilea strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mansselfpossession mingled at that moment in rostovs souli am not talking about you he said i dont know you andfrankly i dont want to i am speaking of the staff in generaland i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone ofquiet authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree withyou that it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficientselfrespect but admit that the time and place are very badly chosenin a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and moreserious duel and besides drubetskoy who says he is an old friendof yours is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune todisplease you however he added rising you know my name andwhere to find me but dont forget that i do not regard either myselfor you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you myadvice is to let the matter drop well then on friday after the reviewi shall expect you drubetskoy au revoir exclaimed prince andrewand with a bow to them both he went outonly when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of what he ought tohave said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it heordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rodehome should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affectedadjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worriedhim all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have atseeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered byhis pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knewthere was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that veryadjutant whom he so hatedchapter viiithe day after rostov had been to see boris a review was held of theaustrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia andthose who had been campaigning under kutuzov the two emperorsthe russian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with thearchduke inspected the allied army of eighty thousand menfrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming upon the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonetsmoved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flyingformed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses ofinfantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat ofhoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braideduniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roanor gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of thepolished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and withthe smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between theinfantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only thegenerals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawnin to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars andwearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomadedofficers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face andhis weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomedtill its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane laysmoothfelt that no small matter was happening but an important andsolemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his owninsignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men andyet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of thatenormous wholefrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by tenoclock all had been brought into due order the ranks were drawnup on the vast field the whole army was extended in three lines thecavalry in front behind it the artillery and behind that again theinfantrya space like a street was left between each two lines of troops thethree parts of that army were sharply distinguished kutuzovsfighting army with the pavlograds on the right flank of the frontthose recently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of theline and the austrian troops but they all stood in the same linesunder one command and in a like orderlike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper theyre comingtheyre coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of finalpreparation swept over all the troopsfrom the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was seenapproaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gustof wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on thelances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs itlooked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing itsjoy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shoutingeyes front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this wasrepeated by others from various sides and all became silentin the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard thiswas the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and thetrumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march itseemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the armyitself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst intomusic amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperoralexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and thefirst regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously andjoyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and theimmensity of the power they constitutedrostov standing in the front lines of kutuzovs army which the tsarapproached first experienced the same feeling as every other man inthat army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a proud consciousness ofmight and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of thistriumphhe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and hehimself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and watercommit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he couldnot but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that wordhurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regimentafter another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and thenhurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrahgrowing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roartill the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobilityseemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became aliveits thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he hadalready passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voicesamid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned tostone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly butsymmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two mentheemperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of thatwhole mass of men was concentratedthe handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horseguards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with hispleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyonesattentionrostov was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight hadrecognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twentypaces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of hishandsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tendernessand ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and everymovement of the tsars seemed to him enchantingstopping in front of the pavlograds the tsar said something in frenchto the austrian emperor and smiledseeing that smile rostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a stillstronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love insome way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsarcalled the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to himoh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to methought rostov i should die of happinessthe tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen ithank you with my whole heart to rostov every word sounded like avoice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsaryou have earned the st georges standards and will be worthy ofthemoh to die to die for him thought rostovthe tsar said something more which rostov did not hear and thesoldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrahrostov too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all hismight feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout ifonly to express his rapture fullythe tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecidedhow can the emperor be undecided thought rostov but then eventhis indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everythingelse the tsar didthat hesitation lasted only an instant the tsars foot in the narrowpointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed baymare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and hemoved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aidesdecampfarther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till atlast only his white plumes were visible to rostov from amid the suitesthat surrounded the emperorsamong the gentlemen of the suite rostov noticed bolkonski sittinghis horse indolently and carelessly rostov recalled their quarrel ofyesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or oughtnot to challenge bolkonski of course not he now thought isit worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of suchlove such rapture and such selfsacrifice what do any of our quarrelsand affronts matter i love and forgive everybody nowwhen the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops begana ceremonial march past him and rostov on bedouin recently purchasedfrom denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadronthat isalone and in full view of the emperorbefore he reached him rostov who was a splendid horseman spurredbedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which theanimal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest histail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the emperors eyeupon him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and gracefulaction as if flying through the air without touching the groundrostov himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feelinghimself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning butblissful face like a vewy devil as denisov expressed itfine fellows the pavlograds remarked the emperormy god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the firethis instant thought rostovwhen the review was over the newly arrived officers and alsokutuzovs collected in groups and began to talk about the awardsabout the austrians and their uniforms about their lines aboutbonaparte and how badly the latter would fare now especially if theessen corps arrived and prussia took our sidebut the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander hisevery word and movement was described with ecstasythey all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against theenemy under the emperors command commanded by the emperor himselfthey could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thoughtrostov and most of the officers after the reviewall were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battleswould have made themchapter ixthe day after the review boris in his best uniform and with hiscomrade bergs best wishes for success rode to olmutz to seebolkonski wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himselfthe best post he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some importantpersonage a position in the army which seemed to him most attractiveit is all very well for rostov whose father sends him ten thousandrubles at a time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and notbe anyones lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have tomake a career and must not miss opportunities but must avail myself ofthem he reflectedhe did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance ofthe town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationedand the two emperors were living with their suites households andcourts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher worldhe knew no one and despite his smart guardsmans uniform all theseexalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriageswith their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and militarymen seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of theguards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not beaware of his existence at the quarters of the commander in chiefkutuzov where he inquired for bolkonski all the adjutants and eventhe orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that agreat many officers like him were always coming there and that everybodywas heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because ofit next day november after dinner he again went to olmutz andentering the house occupied by kutuzov asked for bolkonski princeandrew was in and boris was shown into a large hall probably formerlyused for dancing but in which five beds now stood and furniture ofvarious kinds a table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearestthe door was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writinganother the red stout nesvitski lay on a bed with his arms under hishead laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third wasplaying a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying onthe clavichord sang the tune bolkonski was not there none of thesegentlemen changed his position on seeing boris the one who was writingand whom boris addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkonskiwas on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into thereception room if he wished to see him boris thanked him and went tothe reception room where he found some ten officers and generalswhen he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously withthat peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says ifit were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment waslistening to an old russian general with decorations who stood veryerect almost on tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on hispurple face reporting somethingvery well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to thegeneral in russian speaking with the french intonation he affectedwhen he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing boris princeandrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploringhim to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerfulsmileat that moment boris clearly realized what he had before surmised thatin the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in themilitary code which he and the others knew in the regiment there wasanother more important subordination which made this tightlacedpurplefaced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew forhis own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskoy more thanever was boris resolved to serve in future not according to the writtencode but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by havingbeen recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the generalwho at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of theguards prince andrew came up to him and took his handi am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing aboutwith germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositionswhen germans start being accurate theres no end to itboris smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding toas something generally known but it was the first time he had heardweyrothers name or even the term dispositionswell my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i havebeen thinking about youyes i was thinkingfor some reason boris could not helpblushingof asking the commander in chief he has had a letter fromprince kuragin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guardswont be in action he added as if in apologyall right all right well talk it over replied prince andrewonly let me report this gentlemans business and i shall be atyour disposalwhile prince andrew went to report about the purplefaced general thatgentlemanevidently not sharing boris conception of the advantagesof the unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at thepresumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had tosay to the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned away andwaited impatiently for prince andrews return from the commander inchiefs roomyou see my dear fellow i have been thinking about yousaid prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where theclavichord was its no use your going to the commander in chiefhe would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner thatwould not be bad as regards the unwritten code thought borisbut nothing more would come of it there will soon be a battalion ofus aidesdecamp and adjutants but this is what well do i havea good friend an adjutant general and an excellent fellow princedolgorukov and though you may not know it the fact is that nowkutuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing everything isnow centered round the emperor so we will go to dolgorukov i have togo there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we shallsee whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for yousomewhere nearer the sunprince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a youngman and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining helpof this kind for another which from pride he would never accept forhimself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success andwhich attracted him he very readily took up boris cause and wentwith him to dolgorukovit was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutzoccupied by the emperors and their retinuesthat same day a council of war had been held in which all the members ofthe hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contraryto the views of the old generals kutuzov and prince schwartzenberg ithad been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonapartethe council of war was just over when prince andrew accompaniedby boris arrived at the palace to find dolgorukov everyone atheadquarters was still under the spell of the days council at whichthe party of the young had triumphed the voices of those who counseleddelay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had beenso completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusiveevidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussedat the councilthe coming battle and the victory that would certainlyresult from itno longer seemed to be in the future but in the pastall the advantages were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedlysuperior to napoleons were concentrated in one place the troopsinspired by the emperors presence were eager for action thestrategic position where the operations would take place was familiar inall its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident hadordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on thevery fields where the french had now to be fought the adjacentlocality was known and shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparteevidently weakened was undertaking nothingdolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had justreturned from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proudof the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced hisprotege but prince dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his handsaid nothing to boris and evidently unable to suppress the thoughtswhich were uppermost in his mind at that moment addressed prince andrewin frenchah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant thatthe one that will result from it will be as victorious however dearfellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to havingbeen unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother whatexactitude what minuteness what knowledge of the locality whatforesight for every eventuality every possibility even to the smallestdetail no my dear fellow no conditions better than our present onescould have been devised this combination of austrian precision withrussian valorwhat more could be wished forso the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkonskiand do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte hasdecidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from himtoday for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantlyis that so and what did he say inquired bolkonskiwhat can he say tradiridira and so on merely to gain timei tell you he is in our hands thats certain but what was mostamusing he continued with a sudden goodnatured laugh was thatwe could not think how to address the reply if not as consuland of course not as emperor it seemed to me it should be togeneral bonapartebut between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him generalbonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkonskithats just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughingyou know bilibinhes a very clever fellow he suggestedaddressing him as usurper and enemy of mankinddolgorukov laughed merrilyonly that said bolkonskiall the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for theaddress he is a wise and clever fellowwhat was itto the head of the french government au chef du gouvernementfrancais said dolgorukov with grave satisfaction goodwasnt ityes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkonskioh yes very much my brother knows him hes dined with himthepresent emperormore than once in paris and tells me he never met amore cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of frenchadroitness and italian playacting do you know the tale about him andcount markov count markov was the only man who knew how to handlehim you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightfuland the talkative dolgorukov turning now to boris now to princeandrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassadorpurposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood lookingat markov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and howmarkov immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up withouttouching bonapartesdelightful said bolkonski but i have come to you princeas a petitioner on behalf of this young man you see butbefore prince andrew could finish an aidedecamp came in to summondolgorukov to the emperoroh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hurriedly andpressing the hands of prince andrew and boris you know i shouldbe very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear youngman again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression ofgoodnatured sincere and animated levity but you see anothertimeboris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powersas he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that herehe was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormousmovements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tinyobedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov outinto the corridor and metcoming out of the door of the emperorsroom by which dolgorukov had entereda short man in civilian clotheswith a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoilinghis face gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expressionthis short man nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and staredat prince andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him andevidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrewdid neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the otherturned away and went down the side of the corridorwho was that asked borishe is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant ofmenthe minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski itis such men as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkonskiwith a sigh he could not suppress as they passed out of the palacenext day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle ofausterlitz boris was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukovagain and remained for a while with the ismaylov regimentchapter xat dawn on the sixteenth of november denisovs squadron inwhich nicholas rostov served and which was in prince bagrationsdetachment moved from the place where it had spent the night advancinginto action as arranged and after going behind other columns forabout two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad rostov saw thecossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantrybattalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generalsbagration and dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants all the fearbefore action which he had experienced as previously all the innerstruggle to conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himselfas a true hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadronremained in reserve and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull andwretched mood at nine in the morning he heard firing in front andshouts of hurrah and saw wounded being brought back there were notmany of them and at last he saw how a whole detachment of frenchcavalry was brought in convoyed by a sotnya of cossacks evidently theaffair was over and though not big had been a successful engagementthe men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory of theoccupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a whole frenchsquadron the day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost andthe cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news ofvictory which was conveyed not only by the tales of those who had takenpart in it but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiersofficers generals and adjutants as they passed rostov going orcoming and nicholas who had vainly suffered all the dread thatprecedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity was allthe more depressedcome here wostov lets dwink to dwown our gwief shouteddenisov who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and somefoodthe officers gathered round denisovs canteen eating and talkingthere they are bringing another cried one of the officersindicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot bytwo cossacksone of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he hadtaken from the prisonersell us that horse denisov called out to the cossacksif you like your honorthe officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisonerthe french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a germanaccent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and whenhe heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officersaddressing first one then another he said he would not have beentaken it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him toseize some horsecloths though he had told him the russians were thereand at every word he added but dont hurt my little horse andstroked the animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where hewas now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and nowimagining himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierlydiscipline and zeal in the service he brought with him into ourrearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which wasso alien to usthe cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostov being therichest of the officers now that he had received his money bought itbut dont hurt my little horse said the alsatian goodnaturedlyto rostov when the animal was handed over to the hussarrostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him moneyalley alley said the cossack touching the prisoners arm tomake him go onthe emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussarsall began to run and bustle and rostov saw coming up the road behindhim several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyonewas in his place waitingrostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mountedinstantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected moodamid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought ofhimself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness tothe emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for theday he had lost he was happy as a lover when the longedfor moment ofmeeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round hewas ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from thesound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drewnear everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and morefestive around him nearer and nearer to rostov came that sun sheddingbeams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himselfenveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calmand majestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord withrostovs feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heardthe emperors voicethe pavlograd hussars he inquiredthe reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared tothat which had said the pavlograd hussarsthe emperor drew level with rostov and halted alexanders face waseven more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review itshone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggestedthe liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy and yet it was the faceof the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron theemperors eyes met rostovs and rested on them for not more thantwo seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on inrostovs soul it seemed to rostov that he understood everythingat any rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two seconds intorostovs face a gentle mild light poured from them then all atonce he raised his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his leftfoot and galloped onthe younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at thebattle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelveoclock left the third column with which he had been and gallopedtoward the vanguard before he came up with the hussars severaladjutants met him with news of the successful result of the actionthis battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron wasrepresented as a brilliant victory over the french and so theemperor and the whole army especially while the smoke hung overthe battlefield believed that the french had been defeated and wereretreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor hadpassed the pavlograd division was ordered to advance in wischauitself a petty german town rostov saw the emperor again in themarket place where there had been some rather heavy firing before theemperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom therehad not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suiteof officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare adifferent one from that which he had ridden at the review and bendingto one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and lookedat a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head thewounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximityto the emperor shocked rostov rostov saw how the emperors ratherround shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how hisleft foot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spurand how the welltrained horse looked round unconcerned and did notstir an adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms toplace him on a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groanedgently gently cant you do it more gently said the emperorapparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode awayrostov saw tears filling the emperors eyes and heard him as he wasriding away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is whata terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerrethe troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sightof the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to usat the least firing the emperors gratitude was announced to thevanguard rewards were promised and the men received a double ration ofvodka the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resoundedeven more merrily than on the previous night denisov celebrated hispromotion to the rank of major and rostov who had already drunkenough at the end of the feast proposed the emperors health notour sovereign the emperor as they say at official dinnerssaid he but the health of our

dashing old hussarsbaritonethe hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shoutslate that night when all had separated denisov with his short handpatted his favorite rostov on the

believe it fwiend and i share and appwoveno you dont understandand rostov got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming ofwhat happiness it would be to dienot in saving the emperors lifehe did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before hiseyes he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russianarms and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man toexperience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battleof austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then inlove though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of therussian armschapter xithe next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physicianwas repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troopsnear by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing andhad slept badly that night those around him reported the cause of thisindisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind bythe sight of the killed and woundedat daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come witha flag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor wasbrought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary theemperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at middayhe was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off withprince dolgorukov to the advanced post of the french armyit was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexandera meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army apersonal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign princedolgorukov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiatewith napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations wereactuated by a real desire for peacetoward evening dolgorukov came back went straight to the tsar andremained alone with him for a long timeon the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced twodays march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchangeof shots retreated in the highest army circles from midday on thenineteenth a great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted tillthe morning of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitzwas foughttill midday on the nineteenth the activitythe eager talk running toand fro and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the emperorsheadquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reachedkutuzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columnsby evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of thearmy and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the wholeeighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum ofvoices and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six mileslongthe concentrated activity which had begun at the emperorsheadquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement thatfollowed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large towerclock one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and a thirdand wheels began to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels towork chimes to play figures to pop out and the hands to advance withregular motion as a result of all that activityjust as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the militarymachine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just asindifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmittedto them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yetreached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another andthe revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but aneighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were preparedto remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the levercatches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joinsin the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its kenjust as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerablewheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of thehands which show the time so the result of all the complicated humanactivities of russians and frenchall their passions desiresremorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear andenthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of austerlitz thesocalled battle of the three emperorsthat is to say a slow movementof the hand on the dial of human historyprince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on thecommander in chiefat six in the evening kutuzov went to the emperors headquartersand after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grandmarshal of the court count tolstoybolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of thecoming action from dolgorukov he felt that kutuzov was upsetand dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they weredissatisfied with him and also that at the emperors headquarterseveryone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others donot know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukovwell how dyou do my dear fellow said dolgorukov who wassitting at tea with bilibin the fete is for tomorrow how is yourold fellow out of sortsi wont say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to beheardbut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when hetalks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonapartefears nothing so much as a general battle is impossibleyes you have seen him said prince andrew well what isbonaparte like how did he impress youyes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much asa general engagement repeated dolgorukov evidently prizing thisgeneral conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview withnapoleon if he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for thatinterview why negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat isso contrary to his method of conducting war believe me he is afraidafraid of a general battle his hour has come mark my wordsbut tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew againhe is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should callhim your majesty but who to his chagrin got no title fromme thats the sort of man he is and nothing more replieddolgorukov looking round at bilibin with a smiledespite my great respect for old kutuzov he continued weshould be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give hima chance to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him inour hands no we mustnt forget suvorov and his rulenot to putyourself in a position to be attacked but yourself to attack believeme in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than allthe experience of old cunctatorsbut in what position are we going to attack him i have been at theoutposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces aresituated said prince andrewhe wished to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himselfformedoh that is all the same dolgorukov said quickly and getting uphe spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseenif he is standing before brunnand prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrothersplan of a flanking movementprince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which mighthave been as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage thatweyrothers had already been approved as soon as prince andrew beganto demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own planprince dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly notat the map but at prince andrews facethere will be a council of war at kutuzovs tonight though youcan say all this there remarked dolgorukovi will do so said prince andrew moving away from the mapwhatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilibin whotill then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation andnow was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow bringsvictory or defeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except yourkutuzov there is not a single russian in command of a column thecommanders are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince delichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so onlike all those polish namesbe quiet backbiter said dolgorukov it is not true thereare now two russians miloradovich and dokhturov and there would bea third count arakcheev if his nerves were not too weakhowever i think general kutuzov has come out said princeandrew i wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added andwent out after shaking hands with dolgorukov and bilibinon the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzovwho was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrowsbattlekutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause repliedi think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstoy andasked him to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but mydear general i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after militarymatters yourself yes that was the answer i gotchapter xiishortly after nine oclock that evening weyrother drove with hisplans to kutuzovs quarters where the council of war was to beheld all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander inchiefs and with the exception of prince bagration who declined tocome were all there at the appointed timeweyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by hiseagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfiedand drowsy kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman andpresident of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to beat the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he waslike a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he waspulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along atheadlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might leadto weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picketline to reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian andaustrian to report and explain and to his headquarters where he haddictated the dispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrivedat kutuzovshe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to thecommander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctlywithout looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply toquestions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitifulweary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty andselfconfidentkutuzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions nearostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commanderin chiefs office were gathered kutuzov himself weyrother and themembers of the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaitedprince bagration to begin the council at last bagrations orderlycame with the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew camein to inform the commander in chief of this and availing himselfof permission previously given him by kutuzov to be present at thecouncil he remained in the roomsince prince bagration is not coming we may begin saidweyrother hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table onwhich an enormous map of the environs of brunn was spread outkutuzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged overhis collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chairwith his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the soundof weyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an effortyes yes if you please it is already late said he and noddinghis head he let it droop and again closed his eyeif at first the members of the council thought that kutuzov waspretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading thatfollowed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbedby a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt forthe dispositions or anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying theirresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother withthe gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kutuzov andhaving convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and ina loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for theimpending battle under a heading which he also read outdispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz andsokolnitz november the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began asfollowsas the enemys left wing rests on wooded hills and his rightextends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are therewhile we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank hisright it is advantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especiallyif we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby wecan both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain betweenschlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles ofschlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the enemys front for thisobject it is necessary that the first column marches the secondcolumn marches the third column marches and so on readweyrotherthe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositionsthe tall fairhaired general buxhowden stood leaning his back againstthe wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listenor even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrotherwith his glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon him and his mustachetwisted upwards sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose hiselbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shouldersraised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at weyrothers faceand only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finishedreading then miloradovich looked round significantly at the othergenerals but one could not tell from that significant look whether heagreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements nextto weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never lefthis typically southern french face during the whole time of the readinggazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its cornersa gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of thelongest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raisedhis head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of histhin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but theaustrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked hiselbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be sogood as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes withan expression of perplexity turned round to miloradovich as if seekingan explanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaninglessgaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffboxa geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enoughto be heardprzebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness held hishand to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed inattention dohkturov a little man sat opposite weyrother withan assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread mapconscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality heasked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heardand the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohkturovnoted them downwhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron againbrought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or atanyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry outsuch a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be knownwhereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movementlangerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chiefaim was to show general weyrotherwho had read his dispositions withas much selfconfidence as if he were addressing school childrenthathe had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him somethingin military matterswhen the monotonous sound of weyrothers voice ceased kutuzov openedhis eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheelis interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarkingso you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eyeagain and let his head sink still lowerlangeron trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrothers vanityas author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easilyattack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of thisplan perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm andcontemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objectionsbe they what they mightif he could attack us he would have done so today said heso you think he is powerless said langeronhe has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with thesmile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment ofa casein that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack saidlangeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for supportto miloradovich who was near himbut miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anythingrather than of what the generals were disputing aboutma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on thebattlefieldweyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it wasstrange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and tohave to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of buthad also convinced the sovereign emperors ofthe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard fromhis camp said he what does that mean either he is retreatingwhich is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his positionhe smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position inthe thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all ourarrangements to the minutest detail remain the samehow is that began prince andrew who had for long been waitingan opportunity to express his doubtskutuzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at thegeneralsgentlemen the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today forit is past midnightcannot now be altered said he you haveheard them and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there isnothing more important he paused than to have a good sleephe moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was pastmidnight prince andrew went outthe council of war at which prince andrew had not been able toexpress his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasyimpression whether dolgorukov and weyrother or kutuzov langeronand the others who did not approve of the plan of attack wererighthe did not know but was it really not possible for kutuzovto state his views plainly to the emperor is it possible that onaccount of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of livesand my life my life he thought must be riskedyes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow hethought and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of mostdistant most intimate memories rose in his imagination he rememberedhis last parting from his father and his wife he remembered the dayswhen he first loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry forher and for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood hewent out of the hut in which he was billeted with nesvitski and beganto walk up and down before itthe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamedmysteriously yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorroweverything may be over for me all these memories will be no more noneof them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainlyi have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show alli can do and his fancy pictured the battle its loss theconcentration of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all thecommanders and then that happy moment that toulon for which he hadso long waited presents itself to him at last he firmly and clearlyexpresses his opinion to kutuzov to weyrother and to the emperorsall are struck by the justness of his views but no one undertakes tocarry them out so he takes a regiment a divisionstipulates that noone is to interfere with his arrangementsleads his division tothe decisive point and gains the victory alone but death andsuffering suggested another voice prince andrew however did notanswer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs the dispositionsfor the next battle are planned by him alone nominally he is only anadjutant on kutuzovs staff but he does everything alone the nextbattle is won by him alone kutuzov is removed and he is appointedwell and then asked the other voice if before that you arenot ten times wounded killed or betrayed well what thenwell then prince andrew answered himself i dont knowwhat will happen and dont want to know and cant but if i wantthiswant glory want to be known to men want to be loved by them itis not my fault that i want it and want nothing but that and live onlyfor that yes for that alone i shall never tell anyone but oh godwhat am i to do if i love nothing but fame and mens esteem deathwounds the loss of familyi fear nothing and precious and dearas many persons are to mefather sister wifethose dearest tomeyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them all atonce for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men idont know and never shall know for the love of these men here hethought as he listened to voices in kutuzovs courtyard the voiceswere those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably acoachmans was teasing kutuzovs old cook whom prince andrew knewand who was called tit he was saying tit i say titwell returned the old mango tit thresh a bit said the wagoh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughterof the orderlies and servantsall the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all ivalue this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in thismistchapter xiiithat same night rostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in frontof bagrations detachment his hussars were placed along the linein couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master thesleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with ourarmys campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind himin front of him was misty darkness rostov could see nothing peer ashe would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now therewas something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemyought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes hiseyes kept closing and in his fancy appearednow the emperor nowdenisov and now moscow memoriesand he again hurriedly opened hiseyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he wasriding and sometimes when he came within six paces of them theblack figures of hussars but in the distance was still the same mistydarkness why not it might easily happen thought rostovthat the emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to anyother officer hell say go and find out whats there thereare many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chanceway and attaching him to himself what if he gave me a place near himoh how i would guard him how i would tell him the truth how i wouldunmask his deceivers and in order to realize vividly his lovedevotion to the sovereign rostov pictured to himself an enemy or adeceitful german whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whomhe would slap in the face before the emperor suddenly a distant shoutaroused him he started and opened his eyeswhere am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass andwatchwordshaft olmutz what a nuisance that our squadron will be inreserve tomorrow he thought ill ask leave to go to the frontthis may be my only chance of seeing the emperor it wont be longnow before i am off duty ill take another turn and when i get backill go to the general and ask him he readjusted himself in thesaddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars itseemed to him that it was getting lighter to the left he saw a slopingdescent lit up and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as awall on this knoll there was a white patch that rostov could not atall make out was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon or someunmelted snow or some white houses he even thought something moved onthat white spot i expect its snow that spot a spotunetache he thought there now its not a tache natashasister black eyes na tasha wont she be surprised wheni tell her how ive seen the emperor natasha take mysabretachekeep to the right your honor there are busheshere came the voice of an hussar past whom rostov was riding inthe act of falling asleep rostov lifted his head that had sunk almostto his horses mane and pulled up beside the hussar he was succumbingto irresistible youthful childish drowsiness but what was ithinking i mustnt forget how shall i speak to the emperor nothats not itthats tomorrow oh yes natasha sabretachesaber them whom the hussars ah the hussars with mustaches alongthe tverskaya street rode the hussar with mustaches i thought abouthim too just opposite guryevs house old guryev oh butdenisovs a fine fellow but thats all nonsense the chief thingis that the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to saysomething but dared not no it was i who dared not but thatsnonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important thing iwas thinking of yes natasha sabretache oh yes yes thatsright and his head once more sank to his horses neck all at onceit seemed to him that he was being fired at what what what cutthem down what said rostov waking up at the moment he openedhis eyes he heard in front of him where the enemy was the longdrawnshouts of thousands of voices his horse and the horse of the hussarnear him pricked their ears at these shouts over there where theshouting came from a fire flared up and went out again then anotherand all along the french line on the hill fires flared up and theshouting grew louder and louder rostov could hear the sound of frenchwords but could not distinguish them the din of many voices was toogreat all he could hear was ahahah and rrrrwhats that what do you make of it said rostov to the hussarbeside him that must be the enemys campthe hussar did not replywhy dont you hear it rostov asked again after waiting for areplywho can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantlyfrom the direction it must be the enemy repeated rostovit may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar itsdark steady he cried to his fidgeting horserostovs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen groundpricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shoutinggrew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an armyof several thousand men could produce the lights spread farther andfarther probably along the line of the french camp rostov no longerwanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had astimulating effect on him vive lempereur lempereur he nowheard distinctlythey cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he saidto the hussar beside himthe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the soundof horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars washeard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussarssuddenly appeared looming huge as an elephantyour honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rostovrostov still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode withthe sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the lineone was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov withtheir adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of thelights and shouts in the enemys camp rostov rode up to bagrationreported to him and then joined the adjutants listening to what thegenerals were sayingbelieve me said prince dolgorukov addressing bagration itis nothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard tokindle fires and make a noise to deceive ushardly said bagration i saw them this evening on thatknoll if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that tooofficer said bagration to rostov are the enemys skirmishersstill therethey were there this evening but now i dont know yourexcellency shall i go with some of my hussars to see repliedrostovbagration stopped and before replying tried to see rostovs facein the mistwell go and see he said after a pauseyes sirrostov spurred his horse called to sergeant fedchenko and two otherhussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the directionfrom which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to beriding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous mistydistance where no one had been before him bagration called to him fromthe hill not to go beyond the stream but rostov pretended not to hearhim and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushesfor trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakeshaving descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own orthe enemys fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudlyand distinctly in the valley he saw before him something like a riverbut when he reached it he found it was a road having come out ontothe road he reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it orcross it and ride over the black field up the hillside to keep to theroad which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because itwould be easier to see people coming along it follow me said hecrossed the road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward thepoint where the french pickets had been standing that eveningyour honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him andbefore rostov had time to make out what the black thing was that hadsuddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a reportand a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passedout of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in the panrostov turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followedat intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing indifferent tones rostov reined in his horse whose spirits had risenlike his own at the firing and went back at a footpace well somemore some more a merry voice was saying in his soul but no moreshots cameonly when approaching bagration did rostov let his horse gallop againand with his hand at the salute rode up to the generaldolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and hadonly lit fires to deceive uswhat does that prove he was saying as rostov rode up theymight retreat and leave the picketsits plain that they have not all gone yet prince saidbagration wait till tomorrow morning well find out everythingtomorrowthe picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it wasin the evening reported rostov stooping forward with his hand atthe salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by hisride and especially by the sound of the bulletsvery good very good said bagration thank you officeryour excellency said rostov may i ask a favorwhat is ittomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attachedto the first squadronwhats your namecount rostovoh very well you may stay in attendance on mecount ilya rostovs son asked dolgorukovbut rostov did not replythen i may reckon on it your excellencyi will give the ordertomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to theemperor thought rostovthank godthe fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the factthat while napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops theemperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing himlit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting vive lempereurnapoleons proclamation was as followssoldiers the russian army is advancing against you to avenge theaustrian army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke athollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place the position weoccupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me onthe right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself directyour battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitualvalor carry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but shouldvictory be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperorexposing himself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be nodoubt of victory especially on this day when what is at stake is thehonor of the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nationdo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let everyman be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelingsof england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory willconclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where freshfrench troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peacei shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myselfnapoleonchapter xivat five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of thecenter the reserves and bagrations right flank had not yet movedbut on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillerywhich were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the frenchright flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to planwere already up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which theywere throwing everything superfluous made the eyes smart it was coldand dark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting thesoldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet towarm themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames theremains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that theydid not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guideswere moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heraldsof the advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself neara commanding officers quarters the regiment began to move thesoldiers ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots theirbags into the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank theofficers buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouchesand moved along the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderliesharnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants andbattalion and regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gavefinal instructions orders and commissions to the baggage menwho remained behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feetresounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unablefrom the masses around them the smoke and the increasing fog to seeeither the place they were leaving or that to which they were goinga soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment asmuch as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whateverstrange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor isalways surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship sothe soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks thesame sergeant major ivan mitrich the same company dog jack and thesame commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in whichhis ship is sailing but on the day of battleheaven knows how andwhencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moralatmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisiveand solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day ofbattle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of theirregiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerningwhat is going on around themthe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they couldnot see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and levelground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one mightencounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advancedfor a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hillsavoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground andnowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers becameaware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columnswere moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know thatto the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were goingtoothere now the kurskies have also gone past was being said inthe ranksits wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads lastnight i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regularmoscowthough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked tothe men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out ofhumor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselvesto cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troopsmarched gaily as they always do when going into action especially toan attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fogthe greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousnessof some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how sucha consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but itcertainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptiblyand irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army beenalone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time beforethis consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but asit was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupidgermans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had beenoccasioned by the sausage eaterswhy have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come upagainst the frenchno one cant hear them theyd be firing if we hadthey were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand inthe middle of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damnedgermans muddling what stupid devilsyes id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding upbehind and now here we stand hungryi say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking theway said an officerah those damned germans they dont know their own countrysaid anotherwhat division are you shouted an adjutant riding upthe eighteenththen why are you here you should have gone on long ago now youwont get there till eveningwhat stupid orders they dont themselves know what they aredoing said the officer and rode offthen a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russiantafalafa but what hes jabbering no one can make out said asoldier mimicking the general who had ridden away id shoot themthe scoundrelswe were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent gothalfway fine orders was being repeated on different sidesand the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began toturn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at thegermansthe cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry wasmoving toward our left flank the higher command found that our centerwas too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were allordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed infront of the infantry who had to waitat the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and arussian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should behalted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was toblame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited afteran hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fogthat was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where theywere descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then anotherat first irregularly at varying intervalstratatatand then moreand more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach streambegannot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and havingstumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from theircommanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading throughthe ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or aroundthem in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemylazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders fromthe officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknownsurroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the actionbegan for the first second and third columns which had gone down intothe valley the fourth column with which kutuzov was stood on thepratzen heightsbelow where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on thehigher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what wasgoing on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposedsix miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no oneknew till after eight oclockit was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a seadown below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleonstood with his marshals around him it was quite light above him wasa clear blue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollowcrimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole frencharmy and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far sideof the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which weintended to take up our position and begin the action but were on thisside so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye coulddistinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloakwhich he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arabhorse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hillswhich seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russiantroops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds offiring in the valley not a single muscle of his facewhich in thosedays was still thinmoved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently onone spot his predictions were being justified part of the russianforce had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakesand part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attackand regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that ina hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russiancolumns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in onedirection toward the valley and disappearing one after another intothe mist from information he had received the evening before from thesound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the nightby the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from allindications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far awayin front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constitutedthe center of the russian army and that that center was alreadysufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did notbegin the engagementtoday was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronationbefore dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous andin good spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the fieldin that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everythingsucceeds he sat motionless looking at the heights visible abovethe mist and his cold face wore that special look of confidentselfcomplacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happilyin love the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract hisattention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun floatingup out of the mistwhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist wereaglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin theactionhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a signwith it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshalsaccompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions anda few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidlytoward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded byrussian troops moving down the valley to their leftchapter xvat eight oclock kutuzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourthcolumn miloradovichs the one that was to take the place ofprzebyszewskis and langerons columns which had already gone downinto the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gavethem the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to leadthat column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen hehalted prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming thecommander in chiefs suite he was in a state of suppressed excitementand irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach ofa longawaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day ofhis toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did notknow but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position ofour troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyonein our army his own strategic plan which obviously could not nowbe carried out was forgotten now entering into weyrothers planprince andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projectssuch as might call for his rapidity of perception and decisionto the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forcescould be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight wouldconcentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and therethought he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and therestandard in hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front ofmehe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalionsseeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard withwhich i shall lead the armyin the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights wasa hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like amilkwhite sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into whichour troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firingabove the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orbof the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mistsome wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probablywas for something could be descried on the right the guards wereentering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now andthen a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar massesof cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist in front andbehind moved infantry the commander in chief was standing at the end ofthe village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutuzov seemedworn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a haltwithout any command being given apparently obstructed by something infrontdo order them to form into battalion columns and go round thevillage he said angrily to a general who had ridden up dontyou understand your excellency my dear sir that you must notdefile through narrow village streets when we are marching against theenemyi intended to reform them beyond the village your excellencyanswered the generalkutuzov laughed bitterlyyoull make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemyvery finethe enemy is still far away your excellency according to thedispositionsthe dispositions exclaimed kutuzov bitterly who told youthat kindly do as you are orderedyes sirmy dear fellow nesvitski whispered to prince andrew the oldman is as surly as a dogan austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hatgalloped up to kutuzov and asked in the emperors name had the fourthcolumn advanced into actionkutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fallupon prince andrew who was beside him seeing him kutuzovsmalevolent and caustic expression softened as if admitting that whatwas being done was not his adjutants fault and still not answeringthe austrian adjutant he addressed bolkonskigo my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed thevillage tell it to stop and await my ordershardly had prince andrew started than he stopped himand ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added whatare they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself stillnot replying to the austrianprince andrew galloped off to execute the orderovertaking the battalions that continued to advance he stoppedthe third division and convinced himself that there really were nosharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of theregiment was much surprised at the commander in chiefs order to throwout skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troopsin front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles awaythere was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descenthidden by dense mist having given orders in the commander in chiefsname to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kutuzovstill in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddlewith the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes thetroops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their musketson the groundall right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to ageneral who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as allthe leftflank columns had already descendedplenty of time your excellency muttered kutuzov in the midst ofa yawn plenty of time he repeatedjust then at a distance behind kutuzov was heard the sound of regimentssaluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extendedline of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they weregreeting was riding quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in frontof which kutuzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to oneside and looked round with a frown along the road from pratzen gallopedwhat looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of themrode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform withwhite plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other whowas in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperorsfollowed by their suites kutuzov affecting the manners of an oldsoldier at the front gave the command attention and rode upto the emperors with a salute his whole appearance and manner weresuddenly transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeyswithout reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struckalexander unpleasantly he rode up and salutedthis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy faceof the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanishedafter his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the fieldof olmutz where bolkonski had seen him for the first time abroad butthere was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildnessin his fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity forvarying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodheartedinnocent youthat the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemedbrighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping twomiles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked roundat the faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartoryskinovosiltsev prince volkonsky strogonov and the others all richlydressed gay young men on splendid wellgroomed fresh only slightlyheated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind theemperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat veryerect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely andpreoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and askedsome questionmost likely he is asking at what oclock theystarted thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance witha smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at brunnin the emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of theguard and line regiments russian and austrian among them were groomsleading the tsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroideredclothsas when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields entersa stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence ofsuccess reached kutuzovs cheerless staff with the galloping adventof all these brilliant young menwhy arent you beginning michael ilarionovich said theemperor alexander hurriedly to kutuzov glancing courteously at thesame time at the emperor francisi am waiting your majesty answered kutuzov bending forwardrespectfullythe emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had notquite heardwaiting your majesty repeated kutuzov prince andrew notedthat kutuzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said theword waiting not all the columns have formed up yet yourmajestythe tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged hisrather round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was near him asif complaining of kutuzovyou know michael ilarionovich we are not on the empress fieldwhere a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled saidthe tsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if invitinghim if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but theemperor francis continued to look about him and did not listenthat is just why i do not begin sire said kutuzov in aresounding voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not beingheard and again something in his face twitchedthat is just whyi do not begin sire because we are not on parade and not on theempress field said he clearly and distinctlyin the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expresseddissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not hecertainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to saythe tsar looked intently and observantly into kutuzovs eyewaiting to hear whether he would say anything more but kutuzov withrespectfully bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lastedfor about a minutehowever if you command it your majesty said kutuzov liftinghis head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning butsubmissive generalhe touched his horse and having called miloradovich the commander ofthe column gave him the order to advancethe troops again began to move and two battalions of the novgorod andone of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperoras this apsheron battalion marched by the redfaced miloradovichwithout his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormoustuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners frontand back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reinedin his horse before the emperorgod be with you general said the emperorma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilitesire he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles amongthe gentlemen of the tsars suite by his poor french indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to do siremiloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a littlebehind the emperor the apsheron men excited by the tsars presencepassed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold briskpacelads shouted miloradovich in a loud selfconfident and cheeryvoice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect ofbattle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons his comrades insuvorovs time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that heforgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first villageyouve had to take cried heglad to do our best shouted the soldiersthe emperors horse started at the sudden cry this horse that hadcarried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on thefield of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot andpricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on theempress field not understanding the significance of the firing norof the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that wasbeing said thought and felt that day by its riderthe emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made aremark to him pointing to the gallant apsheronschapter xvikutuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind thecarabineerswhen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column hestopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been aninn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops weremarching along boththe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visibleabout a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below onthe left the firing became more distinct kutuzov had stopped and wasspeaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behindlooking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glasslook look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in thedistance but down the hill before him its the frenchthe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass tryingto snatch it from one another the expression on all their facessuddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be amile and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just infront of usits the enemy no yes see it is for certain buthow is that said different voiceswith the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not morethan five hundred paces from where kutuzov was standing a dense frenchcolumn coming up to meet the apsheronshere it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has comethought prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutuzovthe apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but atthat very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heardquite close at hand and a voice of naive terror barely two steps fromprince andrew shouted brothers alls lost and at this as ifat a command everyone began to runconfused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where fiveminutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would ithave been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not tobe carried back with it oneself bolkonski only tried not to losetouch with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what washappening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face red and unlikehimself was shouting to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at oncehe would certainly be taken prisoner kutuzov remained in the sameplace and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowingfrom his cheek prince andrew forced his way to himyou are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling ofhis lower jawthe wound is not here it is there said kutuzov pressing thehandkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiersstop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizingthat it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to therighta fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with itthe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded bythem it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get onwhy are you hindering us another in the same place turned round andfired in the air a third was striking the horse kutuzov himself rodehaving by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of menkutuzov with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward asound of artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowdof fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutuzov saw on theslope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firingand frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantryneither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with thefleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry andapproached kutuzov of kutuzovs suite only four remained they wereall pale and exchanged looks in silencestop those wretches gasped kutuzov to the regimental commanderpointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punishhim for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and acrosskutuzovs suite like a flock of little birdsthe french had attacked the battery and seeing kutuzov were firingat him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his legseveral soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding theflag let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on themuskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing withoutordersoh oh oh groaned kutuzov despairingly and looked aroundbolkonski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousnessof the feebleness of age bolkonski he whispered pointing tothe disordered battalion and at the enemy whats thatbut before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears ofshame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run tothe standardforward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childshere it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard andhearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at himseveral soldiers fellhurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold upthe heavy standard he ran forward with full confidence that the wholebattalion would follow himand really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and thenanother and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrahand overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flagthat was swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but hewas immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard anddragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw ourartillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandonedtheir guns were running toward him he also saw french infantrysoldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the gunsround prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty pacesof the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly andto right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped buthe did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in frontof himat the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a redhairedgunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop whilea french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see thedistraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men whoevidently did not realize what they were doingwhat are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at themwhy doesnt the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmedwhy doesnt the frenchman stab him he will not get away before thefrenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs himand really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up tothe struggling men and the fate of the redhaired gunner who hadtriumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited himwas about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended itseemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the headwith the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst ofit was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he hadbeen looking atwhats this am i falling my legs are giving way thought heand fell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggleof the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the redhaired gunnerhad been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured orsaved but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but theskythe lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with grayclouds gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn notat all as i ran thought prince andrewnot as we ran shoutingand fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightenedand angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do those cloudsglide across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see thatlofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it at last yes allis vanity all falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothingnothing but that but even it does not exist there is nothing butquiet and peace thank godchapter xviion our right flank commanded by bagration at nine oclock the battlehad not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs demand tocommence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himselfprince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of thecommander in chief bagration knew that as the distance between the twoflanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killedwhich he very likely would be and found the commander in chiefwhich would be very difficult he would not be able to get back beforeeveningbagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suiteand the boyish face of rostov breathless with excitement and hope wasthe first to catch his eye he sent himand if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander inchief your excellency said rostov with his hand to his capyou can give the message to his majesty said dolgorukovhurriedly interrupting bagrationon being relieved from picket duty rostov had managed to get a fewhours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolutewith elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally inthat state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant andeasyall his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be ageneral engagement in which he was taking part more than that he wasorderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with amessage to kutuzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morningwas bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full ofjoy and happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the reinand galloped along the line at first he rode along the line ofbagrations troops which had not yet advanced into action but werestanding motionless then he came to the region occupied by uvarovscavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battlehaving passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannonand musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louderin the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shotsat irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shotsbut a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill beforepratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimesseveral of them were not separated from one another but merged into ageneral roarhe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one anotherdown the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreadingand mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonetsvisible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrowlines of artillery with green caissonsrostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what wasgoing on but strain his attention as he would he could not understandor make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men ofsome sort were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troopsbut why whither and who they were it was impossible to make outthese sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on himon the contrary they stimulated his energy and determinationgo on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these soundsand again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther andfarther into the region where the army was already in actionhow it will be there i dont know but all will be well thoughtrostovafter passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of theline the guards was already in actionso much the better i shall see it close he thoughthe was riding almost along the front line a handful of men camegalloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disorderedranks were returning from the attack rostov got out of their wayinvoluntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped onthat is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden manyhundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the wholewidth of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant whiteuniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him andacross his path rostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of theway of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at thesame speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of thehorses were already galloping rostov heard the thud of their hoofsand the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures andeven their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guardsadvancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet themthe horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horsesrostov could already see their faces and heard the commandcharge shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred tofull speed rostov fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack onthe french galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go butstill was not in time to avoid themthe last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrilyon seeing rostov before him with whom he would inevitably collidethis guardsman would certainly have bowled rostov and his bedouin overrostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic menand horses had it not occurred to rostov to flourish his whip beforethe eyes of the guardsmans horse the heavy black horse sixteenhands high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsmandrove his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tailand extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horseguards passed rostov before he heard them shout hurrah andlooking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with someforeign cavalry with red epaulets probably french he could see nothingmore for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere andsmoke enveloped everythingat that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared inthe smoke rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go wherehe was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards thatamazed the french themselves rostov was horrified to hear later thatof all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliantrich youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on theirthousandruble horses only eighteen were left after the chargewhy should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall seethe emperor immediately thought rostov and galloped onwhen he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them andaround them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not somuch because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness onthe soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of theofficerspassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard avoice calling him by namerostovwhat he answered not recognizing borisi say weve been in the front line our regiment attacked saidboris with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have beenunder fire for the first timerostov stoppedhave you he said well how did it gowe drove them back said boris with animation growing talkativecan you imagine it and he began describing how the guards havingtaken up their position and seeing troops before them thought they wereaustrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls dischargedby those troops that they were themselves in the front line and hadunexpectedly to go into action rostov without hearing boris to theend spurred his horsewhere are you off to asked boriswith a message to his majestythere he is said boris thinking rostov had said hishighness and pointing to the grand duke who with his high shouldersand frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmetand horse guards jacket shouting something to a pale whiteuniformed austrian officerbut thats the grand duke and i want the commander in chief or theemperor said rostov and was about to spur his horsecount count shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eageras boris count i am wounded in my right hand and he showed hisbleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained atthe front i held my sword in my left hand count all our familythevon bergshave been knightshe said something more but rostov did not wait to hear it and rodeawayhaving passed the guards and traversed an empty space rostov to avoidagain getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horseguards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the placewhere the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard suddenly heheard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troopswhere he could never have expected the enemy to bewhat can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our armyimpossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himselfand for the issue of the whole battle but be that what it mayhe reflected there is no riding round it now i must look for thecommander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish withthe restthe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostov was more andmore confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village ofpratzen which was full of troops of all kindswhat does it mean what is it whom are they firing at who isfiring rostov kept asking as he came up to russian and austriansoldiers running in confused crowds across his paththe devil knows theyve killed everybody its all up nowhe was told in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugitives whounderstood what was happening as little as he didkill the germans shouted onemay the devil take themthe traitorszum henker diese russen muttered a german hang these russiansseveral wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screamsand groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died downrostov learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firingat one anothermy god what does it all mean thought he and here where atany moment the emperor may see them but no these must be only ahandful of scoundrels it will soon be over it cant be that itcant be only to get past them quicker quickerthe idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostovs head thoughhe saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just wherehe had been ordered to look for the commander in chief he could notdid not wish to believe thatchapter xviiirostov had been ordered to look for kutuzov and the emperor near thevillage of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officerwere there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds heurged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds butthe farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad onwhich he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of allsorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded andsome not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under thedismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteriesstationed on the pratzen heightswhere is the emperor where is kutuzov rostov kept askingeveryone he could stop but got no answer from anyoneat last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answereh brother theyve all bolted long ago said the soldierlaughing for some reason and shaking himself freehaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk rostov stopped thehorse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began toquestion him the man announced that the tsar had been driven in acarriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road andthat he was dangerously woundedit cant be said rostov it must have been someone elsei saw him myself replied the man with a selfconfident smile ofderision i ought to know the emperor by now after the times iveseen him in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat inthe carriage as pale as anything how they made the four black horsesfly gracious me they did rattle past its time i knew the imperialhorses and ilya ivanych i dont think ilya drives anyone exceptthe tsarrostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a woundedofficer passing by addressed himwho is it you want he asked the commander in chief he waskilled by a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regimentnot killedwounded another officer corrected himwho kutuzov asked rostovnot kutuzov but whats his namewell never mind there arenot many left alive go that way to that village all the commandersare there said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradekand he walked onrostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was nowgoing the emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible todoubt it now rostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in whichhe saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now to sayto the tsar or to kutuzov even if they were alive and unwoundedtake this road your honor that way you will be killed at once asoldier shouted to him theyd kill you thereoh what are you talking about said another where is he togo that way is nearerrostov considered and then went in the direction where they said hewould be killedits all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try tosave myself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatestnumber of men had perished in fleeing from pratzen the french had notyet occupied that region and the russiansthe uninjured and slightlywoundedhad left it long ago all about the field like heaps ofmanure on wellkept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and woundedto each couple of acres the wounded crept together in twos and threesand one could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimesfeignedor so it seemed to rostov he put his horse to a trot toavoid seeing all these suffering men and he felt afraidafraid notfor his life but for the courage he needed and which he knew would notstand the sight of these unfortunatesthe french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead andwounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutantriding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots thesensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses aroundhim merged in rostovs mind into a single feeling of terror and pityfor himself he remembered his mothers last letter what would shefeel thought he if she saw me here now on this field with thecannon aimed at mein the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring fromthe field of battle who though still in some confusion were lessdisordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry firesounded far away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battlewas lost no one whom rostov asked could tell him where the emperoror kutuzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded wascorrect others that it was not and explained the false rumor that hadspread by the fact that the emperors carriage had really gallopedfrom the field of battle with the pale and terrified oberhofmarschalcount tolstoy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others inthe emperors suite one officer told rostov that he had seen someonefrom headquarters behind the village to the left and thither rostovrode not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience whenhe had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russiantroops he saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two menon horseback facing the ditch one with a white plume in his hat seemedfamiliar to rostov the other on a beautiful chestnut horse whichrostov fancied he had seen before rode up to the ditch struck hishorse with his spurs and giving it the rein leaped lightly over onlya little earth crumbled from the bank under the horses hind hoofsturning the horse sharply he again jumped the ditch and deferentiallyaddressed the horseman with the white plumes evidently suggestingthat he should do the same the rider whose figure seemed familiarto rostov and involuntarily riveted his attention made a gesture ofrefusal with his head and hand and by that gesture rostov instantlyrecognized his lamented and adored monarchbut it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty fieldthought rostov at that moment alexander turned his head and rostovsaw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory theemperor was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charmthe mildness of his features was all the greater rostov was happyin the assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded werefalse he was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and evenought to go straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had orderedhim to deliverbut as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter thethoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or achance of delay and flight when the longedfor moment comes and he isalone with her so rostov now that he had attained what he had longedfor more than anything else in the world did not know how to approachthe emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would beinconvenient unseemly and impossible to do sowhat it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage ofhis being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant orpainful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to himnow when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sightof him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperorthat he had composed in his imagination could he now recall thosespeeches were intended for quite other conditions they were for themost part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generallywhen he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroicdeeds and while dying he expressed the love his actions had provedbesides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the rightflank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lostno certainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on hisreflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkindlook or bad opinion from him rostov decided and sorrowfully andwith a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at thetsar who still remained in the same attitude of indecisionwhile rostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly awaycaptain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing theemperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted himto cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feelingunwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside himrostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spokelong and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weepingcovered his eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls handand i might have been in his place thought rostov and hardlyrestraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utterdespair not knowing where to or why he was now ridinghis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness wasthe cause of his griefhe might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign itwas a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had notmade use of it what have i done thought he and he turnedround and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor butthere was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriageswere passing by from one of the drivers he learned that kutuzovsstaff were not far off in the village the vehicles were going torostov followed them in front of him walked kutuzovs groom leadinghorses in horsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an oldbandylegged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coattit i say tit said the groomwhat answered the old man absentmindedlygo tit thresh a bitoh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passedin silence and then the same joke was repeatedbefore five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points morethan a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the frenchprzebyszewski and his corps had laid down

the pratzen heights directed at ourretreating forcesin the rearguard dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept upa musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops itwas growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years theold miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefullyangling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled

jumping over the ice which creakedunder him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun itbearsthe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that itwould give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon evenunder his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to thebank hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at theentrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to addressdolokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd thateveryone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fellfrom his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought ofraising himget onto the ice over the ice go on turn dont you hear goon innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struckthe general the men

butfrom behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop goon go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiersnear the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn andmove on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held underthose on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were onit dashed some forward and some back drowning one anotherstill the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto theice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that coveredthe dam the pond and the bankchapter xixon the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in hishand lay prince andrew bolkonski bleeding profusely and unconsciouslyuttering a gentle piteous and childlike moantoward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still he did not knowhow long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he wasalive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his headwhere is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but sawtoday was his first thought and i did not know this sufferingeither he thought yes i did not know anything anything at alltill now but where am ihe listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voicesspeaking french he opened his eyes above him again was the same loftysky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher andbetween them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his head and did notsee those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden upand stopped near himit was napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp bonaparte ridingover the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteriesfiring at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded lefton the fieldfine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadierwho with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on hisstomach with an already stiffened arm flung widethe ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted yourmajesty said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that werefiring at augesdhave some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having goneon a few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his back withthe flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had alreadybeen taken by the french as a trophythats a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonskiprince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it wasnapoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as sire but heheard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not onlydid they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at onceforgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to deathand he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew itwas napoleonhis herobut at that moment napoleon seemed to himsuch a small insignificant creature compared with what was passing nowbetween himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying overit at that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing overhim or what was said of him he was only glad that people were standingnear him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back tolife which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned tounderstand it so differently he collected all his strength to stir andutter a sound he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groanwhich aroused his own pityah he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up andcarry him to the dressing stationhaving said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat inhand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victoryprince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from theterrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting whilebeing moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing stationhe did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with otherwounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospitalduring this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to lookabout him and even speakthe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a frenchconvoy officer who said rapidly we must halt here the emperorwill pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemenprisonersthere are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian armythat he is probably tired of them said another officerall the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperoralexanders guards said the first one indicating a russianofficer in the white uniform of the horse guardsbolkonski

repninyour regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleonthe praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest rewardsaid repnini bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that youngman beside youprince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelenafter looking at him napoleon smiledhes very young to come to meddle with usyouth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failingvoicea splendid reply said napoleon young man you will go farprince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperorseyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract hisattention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefieldand addressing him again used the epithet young man that wasconnected in his memory with prince andrewwell and you young man said he how do you feel monbravethough five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a fewwords to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixedstraight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that momentseemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did hishero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appearcompared to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen andunderstood that he could not answer himeverything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with thestern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of bloodsuffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking intonapoleons eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance ofgreatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand andthe still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no onealive could understand or explainthe emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one ofthe officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and takento my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds au revoirprince repnin and he spurred his horse and galloped awayhis face shone with selfsatisfaction and pleasurethe soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken thelittle gold icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck butseeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened toreturn the holy imageprince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but thelittle icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chestoutside his uniformit would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon hissister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence itwould be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems tomary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this lifeand what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm ishould be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but towhom should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensiblewhich i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express inwordsthe great all or nothing said he to himself or tothat god who has been sewn into this amulet by mary there is nothingcertain nothing at all except the unimportance of everything iunderstand and the greatness of something incomprehensible butallimportantthe stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable painhis feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his fatherwife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the nightbefore the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon andabove all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his deliriousfanciesthe quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presenteditself to him he was already enjoying that happiness when thatlittle napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look ofshortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and tormentshad followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morningall these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness ofunconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons doctorlarrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescencehe is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will notrecoverand prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care ofthe inhabitants of the districtbook four chapter iearly in the year nicholas rostov returned home on leave denisovwas going home to voronezh and rostov persuaded him to travel with himas far as moscow and

expecting something more more and yet morenext morning after the fatigues of their journey the travelers slepttill ten oclockin the room next to their bedroom there was a confusion of saberssatchels

smile whenrostov met sonya in the drawing room he reddened he did not knowhow to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment ofmeeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could notbe done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters waslooking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behavewith her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but asyousonya but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tenderkisses her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared bynatashas intermediacy to remind him of his promise and thenthanked him for his love his looks thanked her for offering him hisfreedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease tolove her for that would be impossiblehow strange it is said vera selecting a moment when all weresilent that sonya and nicholas now say you to one another and meetlike strangersveras remark was correct as her remarks always were but likemost of her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable notonly sonya nicholas and natasha but even the old countesswhodreading this love affair which might hinder nicholas from makinga brilliant matchblushed like a girldenisov to rostovs surprise appeared in the drawing room withpomaded hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart ashe made himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to theladies and gentlemen than rostov had ever expected to see himchapter iion his return to moscow from the army nicholas rostov was welcomedby his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darlingnikolenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite youngman by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a gooddancer and one of the best matches in the citythe rostovs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enoughthat year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholasacquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of thelatest cut such as no one else yet had in moscow and boots of thelatest fashion with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurspassed his time very gaily after a short period of adapting himselfto the old conditions of life nicholas found it very pleasant to beat home again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much hisdespair at failing in a scripture examination his borrowing money fromgavril to pay a sleigh driver his kissing sonya on the slyhe nowrecalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behindnow he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver andwearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery inaction and in the company of wellknown elderly and respected racingmen was training a trotter of his own for a race he knew a lady on oneof the boulevards whom he visited of an evening he led the mazurkaat the arkharovs ball talked about the war with field marshalkamenski visited the english club and was on intimate terms with acolonel of forty to whom denisov had introduced himhis passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but still ashe did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him he often spokeabout him and about his love for him letting it be understood that hehad not told all and that there was something in his feelings for theemperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he sharedthe adoration then common in moscow for the emperor who was spoken ofas the angel incarnateduring rostovs short stay in moscow before rejoining the army hedid not draw closer to sonya but rather drifted away from her she wasvery pretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he wasat the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is notime for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself andprizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things when hethought of sonya during this stay in moscow he said to himselfah there will be and there are many more such girls somewhere whomi do not yet know there will be time enough to think about love when iwant to but now i have no time besides it seemed to him that thesociety of women was rather derogatory to his manhood he went to ballsand into ladies society with an affectation of doing so against hiswill the races the english club sprees with denisov and visits toa certain housethat was another matter and quite the thing for adashing young hussarat the beginning of march old count ilya rostov was very busyarranging a dinner in honor of prince bagration at the english clubthe count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown givingorders to the club steward and to the famous feoktist the clubshead cook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal andfish for this dinner the count had been a member and on the committeeof the club from the day it was founded to him the club entrusted thearrangement of the festival in honor of bagration for few men knewso well how to arrange a feast on an openhanded hospitable scaleand still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out oftheir own resources what might be needed for the success of the fetethe club cook and the steward listened to the counts orders withpleased faces for they knew that under no other management could theyso easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costingseveral thousand rubleswell then mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup youknowshall we have three cold dishes then asked the cookthe count consideredwe cant have lessyes three the mayonnaise thats onesaid he

littlecountess to have a rest but remembering something else ofimportance he returned again called back the cook and the clubsteward and again began giving orders a light footstep and theclinking of spurs were heard at the door and the young count handsomerosy with a dark little mustache evidently rested and made sleeker byhis easy life in moscow entered the roomah my boy my heads in a whirl said the old man with a smileas if he felt a little confused before his son now if you wouldonly help a bit i must have singers too i shall have my own orchestrabut shouldnt we get the gypsy singers as

pretended to be angryyes you talk but try it yourselfand the count turned to the cook who with a shrewd and respectfulexpression looked observantly and sympathetically at the father andsonwhat have the young people come to nowadays eh feoktist saidhe laughing at us old fellowsthats so your excellency all they have to do is to eat a gooddinner but providing it and serving it all up thats not

asked nicholaslaughing dear dearat that moment with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslikepreoccupied yet meekly christian look which never left her face annamikhaylovna entered the hall though she came upon the count in hisdressing gown every day he invariably became confused and begged her toexcuse his costumeno matter at all my dear count she said meekly closing hereyes but ill go to

asked both the young and old rostovanna mikhaylovna sighed deeplydolokhov mary ivanovnas son she said in a mysteriouswhisper has compromised her completely they say pierre took himup invited him to his house in petersburg and now she has come hereand that daredevil after her said anna mikhaylovna wishing to showher sympathy for pierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smilebetraying her sympathy for the daredevil as she called dolokhovthey say pierre is quite broken by his misfortunedear dear but still tell him to come to the clubit will all blowover it will be a tremendous banquetnext day the third of march soon after one oclock two hundred andfifty members of the english club and fifty guests were awaiting theguest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince bagration todinneron the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz moscow hadbeen bewildered at that time the russians were so used to victoriesthat on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe itwhile others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange anevent in the english club where all who were distinguished importantand well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive indecember nothing was said about the war and the last battle asthough all were in a conspiracy of silence the men who set the tonein conversationcount rostopchin prince yuri dolgorukov valuevcount markov and prince vyazemskidid not show themselves at theclub but met in private houses in intimate circles and themoscovites who took their opinions from othersilya rostov amongthemremained for a while without any definite opinion on the subjectof the war and without leaders the moscovites felt that something waswrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult and so it was bestto be silent but after a while just as a jury comes out of its roomthe bigwigs who guided the clubs opinion reappeared and everybodybegan speaking clearly and definitely reasons were found for theincredible unheardof and impossible event of a russian defeateverything became clear and in all corners of moscow the same thingsbegan to be said these reasons were the treachery of the austrians adefective commissariat the treachery of the pole przebyszewski and ofthe frenchman langeron kutuzovs incapacity and it was whisperedthe youth and inexperience of the sovereign who had trusted worthlessand insignificant people but the army the russian army everyonedeclared was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor thesoldiers officers and generals were heroes but the hero of heroes wasprince bagration distinguished by his schon grabern affair and bythe retreat from austerlitz where he alone had withdrawn his columnunbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerousas his own what also conduced to bagrations being selected asmoscows hero was the fact that he had no connections in the cityand was a stranger there in his person honor was shown to a simplefighting russian soldier without connections and intrigues and to onewho was associated by memories of the italian campaign with the name ofsuvorov moreover paying such honor to bagration was the best way ofexpressing disapproval and dislike of kutuzovhad there been no bagration it would have been necessary toinvent him said the wit shinshin parodying the words of voltairekutuzov no one spoke of except some who abused him in whisperscalling him a court weathercock and an old satyrall moscow repeated prince dolgorukovs saying if you go onmodeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggestingconsolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories and thewords of rostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to battleby highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show themthat it is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that russiansoldiers only need to be restrained and held back on all sides new andfresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown byour officers and men at austerlitz one had saved a standard anotherhad killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehandedberg was mentioned by those who did not know him as having whenwounded in the right hand taken his sword in the left and goneforward of bolkonski nothing was said and only those who knew himintimately regretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wifewith his eccentric fatherchapter iiion that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filledwith a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtimethe members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither satstood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dressand a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaftanspowdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockingsstood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in orderto offer their services most of those present were elderly respectedmen with broad selfconfident faces fat fingers and resolute gesturesand voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitualplaces and met in certain habitual groups a minority of those presentwere casual guestschiefly young men among whom were denisovrostov and dolokhovwho was now again an officer in the semenovregiment the faces of these young people especially those who weremilitary men bore that expression of condescending respect for theirelders which seems to say to the older generation we are prepared torespect and honor you but all the same remember that the future belongsto usnesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at hiswifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacleswent about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull hereas elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience tohis wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people hetreated them with absentminded contemptby his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealthand connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests andso he went from one group to another some of the most important old menwere the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfullyto hear the voices of wellknown men the largest circles formed roundcount rostopchin valuev and naryshkin rostopchin was describinghow the russians had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had toforce their way through them with bayonetsvaluev was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent frompetersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitzin the third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of theaustrian council of war at which suvorov crowed like a cock in reply tothe nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinshin standing closeby tried to make a joke saying that kutuzov had evidently failed tolearn from suvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like acock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making himfeel that in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so ofkutuzovcount ilya rostov hurried and preoccupied went about in his softboots between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting theimportant and unimportant all of whom he knew as if they were allequals while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine wellsetupyoung son resting on him and winking joyfully at him young rostovstood at a window with dolokhov whose acquaintance he had latelymade and highly valued the old count came up to them and presseddolokhovs handplease come and visit us you know my brave boy been togetherout there both playing the hero ah vasili ignatovichhow dye do old fellow he said turning to an old man who waspassing but before he had finished his greeting there was a generalstir and a footman who had run in announced with a frightened facehes arrivedbells rang the stewards rushed forward andlike rye shaken togetherin a shovelthe guests who had been scattered about in different roomscame together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of theballroombagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or swordwhich in accord with the club custom he had given up to the hallporter he had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whipover his shoulder as when rostov had seen him on the eve of the battleof austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreignorders and the star of st george on his left breast evidently justbefore coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmedwhich changed his appearance for the worse there was something naivelyfestive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virilefeatures gave him a rather comical expression bekleshev and theodoreuvarov who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to allow himas the guest of honor to enter first bagration was embarrassed notwishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delayat the doors but after all he did at last enter first he walked shylyand awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowingwhat to do with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowedfield under fire as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment atschon grabernand he would have found that easier the committeemenmet him at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such ahighly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waitingfor his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it wasat first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd ofmembers and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good lookat bagration over each others shoulders as if he were some rareanimal count ilya rostov laughing and repeating the words makeway dear boy make way make way pushed through the crowd moreenergetically than anyone led the guests into the drawing room andseated them on the center sofa the bigwigs the most respected membersof the club beset the new arrivals count ilya again thrusting hisway through the crowd went out of the drawing room and reappeared aminute later with another committeeman carrying a large silver salverwhich he presented to prince bagration on the salver lay some versescomposed and printed in the heros honor bagration on seeing thesalver glanced around in dismay as though seeking help but all eyesdemanded that he should submit feeling himself in their power heresolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly andreproachfully at the count who had presented it to him someoneobligingly took the dish from bagration or he would it seemed haveheld it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it and drew hisattention to the verseswell i will read them then bagration seemed to say andfixing his weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed andserious expression but the author himself took the verses and beganreading them aloud bagration bowed his head and listened bring glory then to alexanders reign and on the throne our titus shield a dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man a rhipheus at home a caesar in the field een fortunate napoleon knows by experience now bagration and dare not herculean russians troublebut before he had finished reading a stentorian majordomo announcedthat dinner was ready the door opened and from the dining room camethe resounding strains of the polonaise conquests joyful thunder waken triumph valiant russians nowand count rostov glancing angrily at the author who went on readinghis verses bowed to bagration everyone rose feeling that dinnerwas more important than verses and bagration again preceding all therest went in to dinner he was seated in the place of honor betweentwo alexandersbekleshev and naryshkinwhich was a significantallusion to the name of the sovereign three hundred persons took theirseats in the dining room according to their rank and importance themore important nearer to the honored guest as naturally as water flowsdeepest where the land lies lowestjust before dinner count ilya rostov presented his son to bagrationwho recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkwardas were all the words he spoke that day and count ilya looked joyfullyand proudly around while bagration spoke to his sonnicholas rostov with denisov and his new acquaintance dolokhov satalmost at the middle of the table facing them sat pierre beside princenesvitski count ilya rostov with the other members of the committeesat facing bagration and as the very personification of moscowhospitality did the honors to the princehis efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and theother fare was splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till theend of the meal he winked at the butler whispered directions to thefootmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety everythingwas excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight ofwhich ilya rostov blushed with selfconscious pleasure the footmenbegan popping corks and filling the champagne glasses after the fishwhich made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances withthe other committeemen there will be many toasts its time tobegin he whispered and taking up his glass he rose all weresilent waiting for what he would sayto the health of our sovereign the emperor he cried and at thesame moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasmthe band immediately struck up conquests joyful thunderwaken all rose and cried hurrah bagration also rose andshouted hurrah in exactly the same voice in which he had shoutedit on the field at schon grabern young rostovs ecstatic voicecould be heard above the three hundred others he nearly wept to thehealth of our sovereign the emperor he roared hurrah andemptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor many followedhis example and the loud shouting continued for a long time when thevoices subsided the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybodysat down again smiling at the noise they had made and exchangingremarks the old count rose once more glanced at a note lying besidehis plate and proposed a toast to the health of the hero of ourlast campaign prince peter ivanovich bagration and again his blueeyes grew moist hurrah cried the three hundred voices againbut instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by paulivanovich kutuzov russians oer all barriers on courage conquest guarantees have we not bagration he brings foemen to their knees etcas soon as the singing was over another and another toast was proposedand count ilya rostov became more and more moved more glass wassmashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to bekleshevnaryshkin uvarov dolgorukov apraksin valuev to the committeeto all the club members and to all the club guests and finally tocount ilya rostov separately as the organizer of the banquet at thattoast the count took out his handkerchief and covering his face weptoutrightchapter ivpierre sat opposite dolokhov and nicholas rostov as usual he ate anddrank much and eagerly but those who knew him intimately noticed thatsome great change had come over him that day he was silent all throughdinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes anda look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge of hisnose his face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and hearnothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by somedepressing and unsolved problemthe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by theprincess his cousin at moscow concerning dolokhovs intimacy withhis wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning whichin the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he sawbadly through his spectacles but that his wifes connection withdolokhov was a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutelydisbelieved both the princess hints and the letter but he fearednow to look at dolokhov who was sitting opposite him every timehe chanced to meet dolokhovs handsome insolent eyes pierre feltsomething terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quicklyaway involuntarily recalling his wifes past and her relations withdolokhov pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might betrue or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wifehe involuntarily remembered how dolokhov who had fully recovered hisformer position after the campaign had returned to petersburg and cometo him availing himself of his friendly relations with pierre as a booncompanion dolokhov had come straight to his house and pierre had puthim up and lent him money pierre recalled how helene had smilinglyexpressed disapproval of dolokhovs living at their house and howcynically dolokhov had praised his wifes beauty to him and from thattime till they came to moscow had not left them for a dayyes he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him itwould be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridiculeme just because i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended himand helped him i know and understand what a spice that would add to thepleasure of deceiving me if it really were true yes if it were truebut i do not believe it i have no right to and cant believe ithe remembered the expression dolokhovs face assumed in his momentsof cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping theminto the water or when he challenged a man to a duel without anyreason or shot a postboys horse with a pistol that expressionwas often on dolokhovs face when looking at him yes he is abully thought pierre to kill a man means nothing to him it mustseem to him that everyone is afraid of him and that must please himhe must think that i too am afraid of himand in fact i am afraid ofhim he thought and again he felt something terrible and monstrousrising in his soul dolokhov denisov and rostov were now sittingopposite pierre and seemed very gay rostov was talking merrily to histwo friends one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notoriousduelist and rake and every now and then he glanced ironically atpierre whose preoccupied absentminded and massive figure was a verynoticeable one at the dinner rostov looked inimically at pierrefirst because pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian thehusband of a beauty and in a wordan old woman and secondly becausepierre in his preoccupation and absentmindedness had not recognizedrostov and had not responded to his greeting when the emperorshealth was drunk pierre lost in thought did not rise or lift hisglasswhat are you about shouted rostov looking at him in an ecstasyof exasperation dont you hear its his majesty the emperorshealthpierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting tillall were seated again turned with his kindly smile to rostovwhy i didnt recognize you he said but rostov was otherwiseengaged he was shouting hurrahwhy dont you renew the acquaintance said dolokhov to rostovconfound him hes a fool said rostovone should make up to the husbands of pretty women said denisovpierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talkingabout him he reddened and turned awaywell now to the health of handsome women said dolokhov andwith a serious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners ofhis mouth he turned with his glass to pierreheres to the health of lovely women peterkinand theirlovers he addedpierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking atdolokhov or answering him the footman who was distributing leafletswith kutuzovs cantata laid one before pierre as one of theprincipal guests he was just going to take it when dolokhov leaningacross snatched it from his hand and began reading it pierre lookedat dolokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrousthat had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of himhe leaned his whole massive body across the tablehow dare you take it he shoutedhearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesvitski and theneighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to bezukhovdont dont what are you about whispered their frightenedvoicesdolokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and thatsmile of his which seemed to say ah this is what i likeyou shant have it he said distinctlypale with quivering lips pierre snatched the copyyou you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated andpushing back his chair he rose from the tableat the very instant he did this and uttered those words pierre feltthat the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting himthe whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmativehe hated her and was forever sundered from her despite denisovsrequest that he would take no part in the matter rostov agreed to bedolokhovs second and after dinner he discussed the arrangements forthe duel with nesvitski bezukhovs second pierre went home butrostov with dolokhov and denisov stayed on at the club till latelistening to the gypsies and other singerswell then till tomorrow at sokolniki said dolokhov as he tookleave of rostov in the club porchand do you feel quite calm rostov askeddolokhov pausedwell you see ill tell you the whole secret of dueling in twowords if you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and writeaffectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may bekilled you are a fool and are lost for certain but go with the firmintention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible andthen all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostroma used to tellme everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one yourfears all gone and your only thought is not to let him get awayand thats how it is with me a demain mon cher till tomorrow my dear fellownext day at eight in the morning pierre and nesvitski drove to thesokolniki forest and found dolokhov denisov and rostov alreadythere pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations whichhad no connection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellowhe had evidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly andscrewed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbedby two considerations his wifes guilt of which after his sleeplessnight he had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness ofdolokhov who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who wasnothing to him i should perhaps have done the same thing in hisplace thought pierre its even certain that i should have donethe same then why this duel this murder either i shall kill him orhe will hit me in the head or elbow or knee cant i go away fromhere run away bury myself somewhere passed through his mind butjust at moments when such thoughts occurred to him he would ask in aparticularly calm and absentminded way which inspired the respect ofthe onlookers will it be long are things readywhen all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriersand the pistols loaded nesvitski went up to pierrei should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tonesand should not justify your confidence and the honor you have doneme in choosing me for your second if at this grave this verygrave moment i did not tell you the whole truth i think there is nosufficient ground for this affair or for blood to be shed over ityou were not right not quite in the right you were impetuousoh yes it is horribly stupid said pierrethen allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponentwill accept them said nesvitski who like the others concerned inthe affair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe thatthe affair had come to an actual duel you know count it is muchmore honorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters becomeirreparable there was no insult on either side allow me toconveyno what is there to talk about said pierre its all thesame is everything ready he added only tell me where to goand where to shoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smilehe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of thetrigger as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that hedid not wish to confessoh yes like that i know i only forgot said heno apologies none whatever said dolokhov to denisov who onhis side had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up tothe appointed placethe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the roadwhere the sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forestcovered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during thelast few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the fartheredge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks inthe deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing andnesvitskis and dolokhovs sabers which were stuck into theground ten paces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty atforty paces distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all hadbeen ready but they still delayed and all were silentchapter vwell begin said dolokhovall right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feelingof dread was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly beguncould no longer be averted but was taking its course independently ofmens willdenisov first went to the barrier and announced as theadvesawies have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take yourpistols and at the word thwee begin to advanceone two thwee he shouted angrily and stepped asidethe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer toone another beginning to see one another through the mist they had theright to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier dolokhovwalked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with hisbright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face his mouth woreits usual semblance of a smileso i can fire when i like said pierre and at the wordthree he went quickly forward missing the trodden path andstepping into the deep snow he held the pistol in his right hand atarms length apparently afraid of shooting himself with it his lefthand he held carefully back because he wished to support his righthand with it and knew he must not do so having advanced six paces andstrayed off the track into the snow pierre looked down at his feetthen quickly glanced at dolokhov and bending his finger as he had beenshown fired not at all expecting so loud a report pierre shudderedat the sound and then smiling at his own sensations stood still thesmoke rendered denser by the mist prevented him from seeing anythingfor an instant but there was no second report as he had expected heonly heard dolokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in viewthrough the smoke he was pressing one hand to his left side whilethe other clutched his drooping pistol his face was pale rostov rantoward him and said somethingnooo muttered dolokhov through his teeth no its notover and after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to thesaber he sank on the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wipedit on his coat and supported himself with it his frowning face waspallid and quiveredplea began dolokhov but could not at first pronounce thewordplease he uttered with an effortpierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward dolokhov andwas about to cross the space between the barriers when dolokhov criedto your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped byhis saber only ten paces divided them dolokhov lowered his head tothe snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himselfdrew in his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he suckedand swallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes stillsmiling glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered hisremaining strength he raised his pistol and aimedsideways cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated nesvitskicover yourself even denisov cried to his adversarypierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legshelplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facingdolokhov and looked sorrowfully at him denisov rostov andnesvitski closed their eyes at the same instant they heard a reportand dolokhovs angry crymissed shouted dolokhov and he lay helplessly face downwardson the snowpierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the foresttrampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent wordsfolly folly death lies he repeated puckering his facenesvitski stopped him and took him homerostov and denisov drove away with the wounded dolokhovthe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answera word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow hesuddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took rostov whowas sitting beside him by the hand rostov was struck by thetotally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression ondolokhovs facewell how do you feel he askedbad but its not that my friend said dolokhov with agasping voice where are we in moscow i know i dont matterbut i have killed her killed she wont get over it she wontsurvivewho asked rostovmy mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother anddolokhov pressed rostovs hand and burst into tearswhen he had become a little quieter he explained to rostov that he wasliving with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive ithe implored rostov to go on and prepare herrostov went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surpriselearned that dolokhov the brawler dolokhov the bully lived in moscowwith an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionateof sons and brotherschapter vipierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and inmoscow their house was always full of visitors the night after theduel he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in hisfathers room that huge room in which count bezukhov had diedhe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all thathad happened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelingsthoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fallasleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace theroom with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days oftheir marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look onher face and then immediately he saw beside her dolokhovs handsomeinsolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet andthen that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been whenhe reeled and sank on the snowwhat has happened he asked himself i have killed her loveryes killed my wifes lover yes that was it and why how did i cometo do itbecause you married her answered an inner voicebut in what was i to blame he asked in marrying her withoutloving her in deceiving yourself and her and he vividly recalledthat moment after supper at prince vasilis when he spoke thosewords he had found so difficult to utter i love you it allcomes from that even then i felt it he thought i felt then thatit was not so that i had no right to do it and so it turns outhe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollectionparticularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection ofhow one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into hisstudy a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his headsteward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and athis dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectfulunderstanding of his employers happinessbut how often i have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beautyand social tact thought he been proud of my house in which shereceived all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty sothis is what i was proud of i then thought that i did not understandher how often when considering her character i have told myself thati was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding thatconstant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desiresand the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depravedwoman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has becomeclearanatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss hernaked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself bekissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she repliedwith a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous lethim do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked her ifshe felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and saidshe was not a fool to want to have children and that she was not goingto have any children by methen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and thevulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she hadbeen brought up in the most aristocratic circlesim not such a fool just you try it on allezvouspromener she used to say often seeing the success she had withyoung and old men and women pierre could not understand why he did notlove her you clear out of thisyes i never loved her said he to himself i knew she was adepraved woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myselfand now theres dolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile andperhaps dying while meeting my remorse with some forced bravadopierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of whatis called weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles hedigested his sufferings aloneit is all all her fault he said to himself but what of thatwhy did i bind myself to her why did i say je vous aime to herwhich was a lie and worse than a lie i am guilty and must endurewhat a slur on my name a misfortune for life oh thatsnonsense he thought the slur on my name and honorthats allapart from myself i love

tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of lifein comparison with eternitybut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflectionsshe suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he hadmost strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt theblood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and breakand tear whatever came to his hand why did i tell her that jevous aime he kept repeating to himself and when he had said itfor the tenth time molieres words mais que diable allaitilfaire dans cette galere occurred to him and he began to laugh

valetshe knew of the duel and had come to speak about it she waited till thevalet had set down the coffee things and left the room pierre lookedat her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by houndswho lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before herenemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senselessand impossible he again glanced timidly at

his body hadnot been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what was worst ofall for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility ofhis having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of theplace and that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone amongstrangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from whichthe old prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated as usualvery briefly and vaguely that after brilliant engagements the russianshad had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order theold prince understood from this

wrote kutuzov fell before my eyes a standard inhis hand and at the head of a regimenthe fell as a hero worthy ofhis father and his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of thewhole army it is

by she looked out the men servants were carrying thelarge leather sofa from prince andrews study into the bedroom ontheir faces was a quiet and solemn lookprincess mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in thehouse now and then opening her door when someone passed and watchingwhat was going on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps inand out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away she didnot venture to ask any questions and shut the door again now sittingdown in her easy chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling beforethe icon stand to her surprise

footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another theprincess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging everyone in thehouse was dominated by the same feeling that princess mary experiencedas she sat in her room but owing to the superstition that the fewerthe people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers everyonetried to pretend not to know no one spoke of it but apart from theordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princeshousehold a common anxiety a softening of the heart and aconsciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplishedat that moment made itself feltthere was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servantshall all sat waiting silently and alert in the outlying serfsquarters torches and candles

perturbedface shook his head and going up to him silently kissed him on theshoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why hehad entered the most solemn mystery in the world

cookswho were not venal i have not yet metthat divine purity and devotion i look for in women if i found such aone id give my life for her but those and he made a gestureof contempt and believe me if i still value my life it isonly because i still hope to meet such a divine creature who willregenerate purify and elevate me but you dont understand itoh yes i quite understand answered rostov who was under hisnew friends influencein the autumn the rostovs returned to moscow early in the winterdenisov also came back and stayed with them the first half of thewinter of which nicholas rostov spent in moscow was one of thehappiest merriest times for him and the whole family nicholas broughtmany young men to his parents house vera was a handsome girlof twenty sonya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an openingflower natasha half grown up and half child was now childishlyamusing now girlishly enchantingat that time in the rostovs house there prevailed an amorousatmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and verycharming girls every young man who came to the houseseeing thoseimpressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their ownhappiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitfulbursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle ofyoung girls ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the samefeeling sharing with the young folk of the rostovs household areadiness to fall in love and an expectation of happinessamong the young men introduced by rostov one of the first wasdolokhov whom everyone in the house liked except natasha she almostquarreled with her brother about him she insisted that he was a badman and that in the duel with bezukhov pierre was right and dolokhovwrong and further that he was disagreeable and unnaturaltheres nothing for me to understand she cried out withresolute selfwill he is wicked and heartless there now i likeyour denisov though he is a rake and all that still i like him soyou see i do understand i dont know how to put it with this oneeverything is calculated and i dont like that but denisovoh denisov is quite different replied nicholas implying thateven denisov was nothing compared to dolokhovyou must understandwhat a soul there is in dolokhov you should see him with his motherwhat a heartwell i dont know about that but i am uncomfortable with him anddo you know he has fallen in love with sonyawhat nonsenseim certain of it youll seenatashas prediction proved true dolokhov who did not usually carefor the society of ladies began to come often to the house and thequestion for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soonsettled he came because of sonya and sonya though she would neverhave dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time dolokhovappeareddolokhov often dined at the rostovs never missed a performance atwhich they were present and went to iogels balls for young peoplewhich the rostovs always attended he was pointedly attentive to sonyaand looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear hisglances without coloring but even the old countess and natasha blushedwhen they saw his looksit was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistibleinfluence of the dark graceful girl who loved anotherrostov noticed something new in dolokhovs relations with sonyabut he did not explain to himself what these new relations weretheyre always in love with someone he thought of sonya andnatasha but he was not as much at ease with sonya and dolokhov asbefore and was less frequently at homein the autumn of everybody had again begun talking of the war withnapoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders weregiven to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular armyand besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia everywherebonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming warwas talked of for the rostov family the whole interest of thesepreparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear ofremaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of denisovsfurlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment hisapproaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rathergave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time awayfrom home at dinners parties and ballschapter xion the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing he hadrarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he and denisovwere leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty peoplewere present including dolokhov and denisovnever had love been so much in the air and never had the amorousatmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostovs house as atthis holiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be lovedthat is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the onething we are interested in here said the spirit of the placenicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses withoutvisiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invitedreturned home just before dinner as soon as he entered he noticed andfelt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed acurious embarrassment among some of those present sonya dolokhovand the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degreenatasha nicholas understood that something must have happened betweensonya and dolokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitivenessnatural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner onthat same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel thedancing master gave for his pupils during the holidaysnicholas will you come to iogels please do said natashahe asked you and vasili dmitrich is also going denisovwhere would i not go at the countess command said denisovwho at the rostovs had jocularly assumed the role of natashasknight im even weady to dance the pas de chaleif i have time answered nicholas but i promised thearkharovs they have a partyand you he asked dolokhov but as soon as he had asked thequestion he noticed that it should not have been putperhaps coldly and angrily replied dolokhov glancing at sonyaand scowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierreat the club dinnerthere is something up thought nicholas and he was furtherconfirmed in this conclusion by the fact that dolokhov left immediatelyafter dinner he called natasha and asked her what was the matterand i was looking for you said natasha running out to him itold you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly hehas proposed to sonyalittle as nicholas had occupied himself with sonya of late somethingseemed to give way within him at this news dolokhov was a suitable andin some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl fromthe point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of thequestion for her to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feelingon hearing the news was one of anger with sonya he tried to saythats capital of course shell forget her childish promisesand accept the offer but before he had time to say it natasha beganagainand fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after apause she told him she loved anotheryes my sonya could not have done otherwise thought nicholasmuch as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont changeonce she has saidand mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfullyyes said natasha do you know nicholasdont beangrybut i know you will not marry her i know heaven knows how buti know for certain that you wont marry hernow you dont know that at all said nicholas but i musttalk to her what a darling sonya is he added with a smileah she is indeed a darling ill send her to youand natasha kissed her brother and ran awaya minute later sonya came in with a frightened guilty and scaredlook nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the firsttime since his return that they had talked alone and about their lovesophie he began timidly at first and then more and moreboldly if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant andadvantageous match but a splendid noble fellow he is my friendsonya interrupted himi have already refused she said hurriedlyif you are refusing for my sake i am afraid that isonya again interrupted she gave him an imploring frightened looknicholas dont tell me that she saidno but i must it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to sayit if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole truth ilove you and i think i love you more than anyone elsethat is enough for me said sonya blushingno but i have been in love a thousand times and shall fall inlove again though for no one have i such a feeling of friendshipconfidence and love as i have for you then i am young mamma doesnot wish it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to considerdolokhovs offer he said articulating his friends name withdifficultydont say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother andalways shall and i want nothing moreyou are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid ofmisleading youand nicholas again kissed her handchapter xiiiogels were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothersas they watched their young people executing their newly learned stepsand so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till theywere ready to drop and so said the grownup young men and women whocame to these balls with an air of condescension and found them mostenjoyable that year two marriages had come of these balls the twopretty young princesses gorchakov met suitors there and were marriedand so further increased the fame of these dances what distinguishedthem from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence ofthe goodnatured iogel flying about like a feather and bowing accordingto the rules of his art as he collected the tickets from all hisvisitors there was the fact that only those came who wished to danceand amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who arewearing long dresses for the first time with scarcely any exceptionsthey all were or seemed to be prettyso rapturous were their smilesand so sparkling their eyes sometimes the best of the pupils of whomnatasha who was exceptionally graceful was first even danced the pasde chale but at this last ball only the ecossaise the anglaise andthe mazurka which was just coming into fashion were danced iogel hadtaken a ballroom in bezukhovs house and the ball as everyone saidwas a great success there were many pretty girls and the rostov girlswere among the prettiest they were both particularly happy and gaythat evening proud of dolokhovs proposal her refusal and herexplanation with nicholas sonya twirled about before she left homeso that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited and she wastransparently radiant with impulsive joynatasha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a realball was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with pinkribbonsnatasha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom shewas not in love with anyone in particular but with everyone whateverperson she happened to look at she was in love with for that momentoh how delightful it is she kept saying running up to sonyanicholas and denisov were walking up and down looking with kindlypatronage at the dancershow sweet she isshe will be a weal beauty said denisovwhocountess natasha answered denisovand how she dances what gwace he said again after a pausewho are you talking aboutabout your sister ejaculated denisov testilyrostov smiledmy dear count you were one of my best pupilsyou must dancesaid little iogel coming up to nicholas look how many charming youngladies he turned with the same request to denisov who was also aformer pupil of hisno my dear fellow ill be a wallflower said denisovdont you wecollect what bad use i made of your lessonsoh no said iogel hastening to reassure him you were onlyinattentive but you had talentoh yes you had talentthe band struck up the newly introduced mazurka nicholas could notrefuse iogel and asked sonya to dance denisov sat down by the oldladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot toldthem something funny and kept them amused while he watched the youngpeople dancing iogel with natasha his pride and his best pupil werethe first couple noiselessly skillfully stepping with his littlefeet in low shoes iogel flew first across the hall with natasha whothough shy went on carefully executing her steps denisov did nottake his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearlyindicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and notbecause he could not in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rostovwho was passingthis is not at all the thing he said what sort of polishmazuwka is this but she does dance splendidlyknowing that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the masterlyway in which he danced the mazurka nicholas ran up to natashago and choose denisov he is a real dancer a wonder he saidwhen it came to natashas turn to choose a partner she rose andtripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows rantimidly to the corner where denisov sat she saw that everybody waslooking at her and waiting nicholas saw that denisov was refusingthough he smiled delightedly he ran up to themplease vasili dmitrich natasha was saying do comeoh no let me off countess denisov repliednow then vaska said nicholasthey coax me as if i were vaska the cat said denisov jokinglyill sing for you a whole evening said natashaoh the faiwy she can do anything with me said denisov andhe unhooked his saber he came out from behind the chairs clasped hispartners hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his footwaiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka wasdenisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellowhe felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked sidewaysat his partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped withone foot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the roomtaking his partner with him he glided silently on one foot half acrossthe room and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight atthem when suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legshe stopped short on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spotclanking his spurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heelagainst his right flew round again in a circle natasha guessed whathe meant to do and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardlyknowing how first he spun her round holding her now with his left nowwith his right hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round himand again jumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as ifhe would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breathand then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpectedsteps when at last smartly whirling his partner round in front of herchair he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her natashadid not even make him a curtsy she fixed her eyes on him in amazementsmiling as if she did not recognize himwhat does this mean she brought outalthough iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyonewas delighted with denisovs skill he was asked again and again asa partner and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and thegood old days denisov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himselfwith his handkerchief sat down by natasha and did not leave her forthe rest of the eveningchapter xiiifor two days after that rostov did not see dolokhov at his own or atdolokhovs home on the third day he received a note from himas i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you knowof and am going to rejoin my regiment i am giving a farewell suppertonight to my friendscome to the english hotelabout ten oclock rostov went to the english hotel straight from thetheater where he had been with his family and denisov he was at onceshown to the best room which dolokhov had taken for that evening sometwenty men were gathered round a table at which dolokhov sat betweentwo candles on the table was a pile of gold and paper money and hewas keeping the bank rostov had not seen him since his proposal andsonyas refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how theywould meetdolokhovs clear cold glance met rostov as soon as he entered thedoor as though he had long expected himits a long time since we met he said thanks for comingill just finish dealing and then ilyushka will come with hischorusi called once or twice at your house said rostov reddeningdolokhov made no replyyou may punt he saidrostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once hadwith dolokhov none but fools trust to luck in play dolokhovhad then saidor are you afraid to play with me dolokhov now asked as ifguessing rostovs thoughtbeneath his smile rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the clubdinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felta need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel actionrostov felt ill at ease he tried but failed to find some joke withwhich to reply to dolokhovs words but before he had thought ofanything dolokhov looking straight in his face said slowly anddeliberately so that everyone could heardo you remember we had a talk about cards hes a fool whotrusts to luck one should make certain and i want to tryto try his luck or the certainty rostov asked himselfwell youd better not play dolokhov added and springing anew pack of cards said bank gentlemenmoving the money forward he prepared to deal rostov sat down by hisside and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at himwhy dont you play he askedand strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up acard putting a small stake on it and beginning to playi have no money with me he saidill trust yourostov staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and againlost dolokhov killed that is beat ten cards of rostovsrunninggentlemen said dolokhov after he had dealt for some timeplease place your money on the cards or i may get muddled in thereckoningone of the players said he hoped he might be trustedyes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so iask you to put the money on your cards replied dolokhov dontstint yourself well settle afterwards he added turning torostovthe game continued a waiter kept handing round champagneall rostovs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scoredup against him he wrote rubles on a card but while thewaiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usualstake of twenty rublesleave it said dolokhov though he did not seem to be evenlooking at rostov youll win it back all the sooner i lose tothe others but win from you or are you afraid of me he asked againrostov submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a sevenof hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor hewell remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the seven of heartson which with a broken bit of chalk he had written rubles inclear upright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that washanded him smiled at dolokhovs words and with a sinking heartwaiting for a seven to turn up gazed at dolokhovs hands which heldthe pack much depended on rostovs winning or losing on that sevenof hearts on the previous sunday the old count had given his sontwo thousand rubles and though he always disliked speaking of moneydifficulties had told nicholas that this was all he could let him havetill may and asked him to be more economical this time nicholas hadreplied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave hisword of honor not to take anything more till the spring now only twelvehundred rubles was left of that money so that this seven of heartsmeant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles but thenecessity of going back on his word with a sinking heart he watcheddolokhovs hands and thought now then make haste and let me havethis card and ill take my cap and drive home to supper with denisovnatasha and sonya and will certainly never touch a card again atthat moment his home life jokes with petya talks with sonya duetswith natasha piquet with his father and even his comfortable bedin the house on the povarskaya rose before him with such vividnessclearness and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost andunappreciated bliss long past he could not conceive that a stupidchance letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the leftmight deprive him of all this happiness newly appreciated and newlyillumined and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefinedmisery that could not be yet he awaited with a sinking heart themovement of dolokhovs hands those broad reddish hands with hairywrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid down the pack and tookup a glass and a pipe that were handed himso you are not afraid to play with me repeated dolokhov and asif about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in hischair and began deliberately with a smileyes gentlemen ive been told theres a rumor going about moscowthat im a sharper so i advise you to be carefulcome now deal exclaimed rostovoh those moscow gossips said dolokhov and he took up the cardswith a smileaah rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head theseven he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he hadlost more than he could paystill dont ruin yourself said dolokhov with a side glance atrostov as he continued to dealchapter xivan hour and a half later most of the players were but little interestedin their own playthe whole interest was concentrated on rostov instead of sixteenhundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against himwhich he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguelysupposed must have risen to fifteen thousand in reality it alreadyexceeded twenty thousand rubles dolokhov was no longer listening tostories or telling them but followed every movement of rostovshands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him he haddecided to play until that score reached fortythree thousand hehad fixed on that number because fortythree was the sum of his andsonyas joint ages rostov leaning his head on both hands sat atthe table which was scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wineand littered with cards one tormenting impression did not leave himthat those broadboned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible fromunder the shirt sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held himin their powersix hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backsimpossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double orquits it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostovpondered sometimes he staked a large sum but dolokhov refused toaccept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and atone moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridgeover the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to handfrom the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted thecords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking thetotal of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the otherplayers or peered at the now cold face of dolokhov and tried to readwhat was passing in his mindhe knows of course what this loss means to me he cant want myruin wasnt he my friend wasnt i fond of him but its not hisfault whats he to do if he has such luck and its not my faulteither he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have ikilled anyone or insulted or wished harm to anyone why such a terriblemisfortune and when did it begin such a little while ago i came tothis table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy thatcasket for mammas name day and then going home i was so happy sofree so lighthearted and i did not realize how happy i was when didthat end and when did this new terrible state of things begin whatmarked the change i sat all the time in this same place at this tablechose and placed cards and watched those broadboned agile hands in thesame way when did it happen and what has happened i am well and strongand still the same and in the same place no it cant be surely itwill all end in nothinghe was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not hothis face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its helplessefforts to seem calmthe score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree thousandrostov had just prepared a card by bending the corner of which hemeant to double the three thousand just put down to his score whendolokhov slamming down the pack of cards put it aside and beganrapidly adding up the total of rostovs debt breaking the chalk ashe marked the figures in his clear bold handsupper its time for supper and here are the gypsiessome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outsideand saying something in their gypsy accents nicholas understood that itwas all over but he said in an indifferent tonewell wont you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if itwere the fun of the game which interested him mostits all up im lost thought he now a bullet through mybrainthats all thats left me and at the same time he saidin a cheerful voicecome now just this one more little cardall right said dolokhov having finished the addition allright twentyone rubles he said pointing to the figure twentyoneby which the total exceeded the round sum of fortythree thousand andtaking up a pack he prepared to deal rostov submissively unbent thecorner of his card and instead of the six thousand he had intendedcarefully wrote twentyoneits all the same to me he said i only want to see whetheryou will let me win this ten or beat itdolokhov began to deal seriously oh how rostov detested at thatmoment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wristswhich held him in their power the ten fell to himyou owe fortythree thousand count said dolokhov andstretching himself he rose from the table one does get tired sittingso long he addedyes im tired too said rostovdolokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not for him tojestwhen am i to receive the money countrostov flushing drew dolokhov into the next roomi cannot pay it all immediately will you take an iou he saidi say rostov said dolokhov clearly smiling and lookingnicholas straight in the eyes you know the saying lucky in loveunlucky at cards your cousin is in love with you i knowoh its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans powerthought rostov he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father andmother by the news of this loss he knew what a relief it would be toescape it all and felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him fromall this shame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a cat doeswith a mouseyour cousin dolokhov started to say but nicholas interruptedhimmy cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary tomention her he exclaimed fiercelythen when am i to have ittomorrow replied rostov and left the roomchapter xvto say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficultbut to go home alone see his sisters brother mother and fatherconfess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word ofhonor was terribleat home they had not yet gone to bed the young people after returningfrom the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichordas soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphereof love which pervaded the rostov household that winter and now afterdolokhovs proposal and iogels ball seemed to have grown thickerround sonya and natasha as the air does before a thunderstorm sonyaand natasha in the lightblue dresses they had worn at the theaterlooking pretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichordhappy and smiling vera was playing chess with shinshin in the drawingroom the old countess waiting for the return of her husband and sonsat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their housedenisov with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichordstriking chords with his short fingers his legs thrown back and hiseyes rolling as he sang with his small husky but true voice someverses called enchantress which he had composed and to which hewas trying to fit music enchantress say to my forsaken lyre what magic power is this recalls me still what spark has set my inmost soul on fire what is this bliss that makes my fingers thrillhe was singing in passionate tones gazing with his sparklingblackagate eyes at the frightened and happy natashasplendid excellent exclaimed natasha another verse shesaid without noticing nicholaseverythings still the same with them thought nicholasglancing into the drawing room where he saw vera and his mother withthe old ladyah and heres nicholas cried natasha running up to himis papa at home he askedi am so glad youve come said natasha without answering himwe are enjoying ourselves vasili dmitrich is staying a day longerfor my sake did you knowno papa is not back yet said sonyanicholas have you come come here dear called the old countessfrom the drawing roomnicholas went to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at hertable began to watch her hands arranging the cards from the dancingroom they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuadenatasha to singall wight all wight shouted denisov its no good makingexcuses now its your turn to sing the bacawollai entweatyouthe countess glanced at her silent sonwhat is the matter she askedoh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked thesame question will papa be back sooni expect soeverythings the same with them they know nothing about it wheream i to go thought nicholas and went again into the dancing roomwhere the clavichord stoodsonya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude todenisovs favorite barcarolle natasha was preparing to singdenisov was looking at her with enraptured eyesnicholas began pacing up and down the roomwhy do they want to make her sing how can she sing theresnothing to be happy about thought hesonya struck the first chord of the preludemy god im a ruined and dishonored man a bullet through my brainis the only thing left menot singing his thoughts ran on goaway but where to its onelet them singhe continued to pace the room looking gloomily at denisov and thegirls and avoiding their eyesnikolenka what is the matter sonyas eyes fixed on himseemed to ask she noticed at once that something had happened to himnicholas turned away from her natasha too with her quick instincthad instantly noticed her brothers condition but though she noticedit she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far fromsorrow sadness or selfreproach that she purposely deceived herselfas young people often do no i am too happy now to spoil myenjoyment by sympathy with anyones sorrow she felt and she saidto herself no i must be mistaken he must be feeling happy just asi amnow sonya she said going to the very middle of the room whereshe considered the resonance was besthaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly as balletdancers do natasha rising energetically from her heels to her toesstepped to the middle of the room and stood stillyes thats me she seemed to say answering the rapt gaze withwhich denisov followed herand what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at hissister why isnt she dull and ashamednatasha took the first note her throat swelled her chest roseher eyes became serious at that moment she was oblivious of hersurroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone mayproduce at the same intervals and hold for the same time but whichleave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrillyou and make you weepnatasha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriouslymainly because denisov so delighted in her singing she no longer sangas a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childishpainstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet singwell as all the connoisseurs who heard her said it is not trainedbut it is a beautiful voice that must be trained only they generallysaid this some time after she had finished singing while that untrainedvoice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions wassounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted init and wished to hear it again in her voice there was a virginalfreshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrainedvelvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing thatit seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoilingitwhat is this thought nicholas listening to her with widelyopened eyes what has happened to her how she is singing todayand suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of thenext note the next phrase and everything in the world was divided intothree beats oh mio crudele affetto one two three onetwo three one oh mio crudele affetto one two threeone oh this senseless life of ours thought nicholas allthis misery and money and dolokhov and anger and honorits allnonsense but this is real now then natasha now then dearestnow then darling how will she take that si shes taken it thankgod and without noticing that he was singing to strengthen the sihe sung a second a third below the high note ah god how fine didi really take it how fortunate he thoughtoh how that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finestin rostovs soul and this something was apart from everything elsein the world and above everything in the world what were losses anddolokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and roband yet be happychapter xviit was long since rostov had felt such enjoyment from music as hedid that day but no sooner had natasha finished her barcarolle thanreality again presented itself he got up without saying a word and wentdownstairs to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old countcame in from his club cheerful and contented nicholas hearing himdrive up went to meet himwellhad a good time said the old count smiling gaily andproudly at his sonnicholas tried to say yes but could not and he nearly burst intosobs the count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sonsconditionah it cant be avoided thought nicholas for the first andlast time and suddenly in the most casual tone which made him feelashamed of himself he said as if merely asking his father to let himhave the carriage to drive to townpapa i have come on a matter of business i was nearly forgetting ineed some moneydear me said his father who was in a specially good humor itold you it would not be enough how muchvery much said nicholas flushing and with a stupid carelesssmile for which he was long unable to forgive himself i have lost alittle i mean a good deal a great dealforty three thousandwhat to whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddeningwith an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people doi promised to pay tomorrow said nicholaswell said the old count spreading out his arms and sinkinghelplessly on the sofait cant be helped it happens to everyone said the son witha bold free and easy tone while in his soul he regarded himself as aworthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime helonged to kiss his fathers hands and kneel to beg his forgivenessbut said in a careless and even rude voice that it happens toeveryonethe old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sons words and beganbustlingly searching for somethingyes yes he muttered it will be difficult i fear difficultto raise happens to everybody yes who has not done itand with a furtive glance at his sons face the count went out of theroom nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at allexpected thispapa papa he called after him sobbing forgive me andseizing his fathers hand he pressed it to his lips and burst intotearswhile father and son were having their explanation the mother anddaughter were having one not less important natasha came

journeyafter denisovs departure rostov spent another fortnight in moscowwithout going out of the house waiting for the money his father couldnot at once raise and he spent most of his time in the girls roomsonya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if shewanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made herlove him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy ofherhe filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at lastsent dolokhov the whole fortythree thousand rubles and received hisreceipt he left at the end of november without taking leave of any ofhis acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in polandbook five chapter iafter his interview with his wife pierre left for petersburg at thetorzhok post station either there were no horses or the postmasterwould not supply them pierre was obliged to wait without undressinghe lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his bigfeet in their overboots on the table and began to reflectwill you have the portmanteaus brought in and a bed got ready andtea asked his valetpierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything he hadbegun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the samequestionone so important that he took no notice of what wenton around him not only was he indifferent as to whether he got topetersburg earlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at thisstation but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was amatter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or forthe rest of his lifethe postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman sellingtorzhok embroidery came into the room offering their serviceswithout changing his careless attitude pierre looked at them over hisspectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go onliving without having solved the problems that so absorbed him he hadbeen engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned fromsokolniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing sleeplessnight but now in the solitude of the journey they seized him withspecial force no matter what he thought about he always returned tothese same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease toask himself it was as if the thread of the chief screw which held hislife together were stripped so that the screw could not get in or outbut went on turning uselessly in the same placethe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency towait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellencyhave the courier horses it was plain that he was lying and only wantedto get more money from the traveleris this good or bad pierre asked himself it is good for mebad for another traveler and for himself its unavoidable becausehe needs money for food the man said an officer had once given him athrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horsesbut the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly aspossible and i continued pierre shot dolokhov because iconsidered myself injured and louis xvi was executed because theyconsidered him a criminal and a year later they executed those whoexecuted himalso for some reason what is bad what is good whatshould one love and what hate what does one live for and what am iwhat is life and what is death what power governs allthere was no answer to any of these questions except one and thatnot a logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer wasyoull die and all will end youll die and know all or ceaseasking but dying was also dreadfulthe torzhok peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering herwares especially a pair of goatskin slippers i have hundreds ofrubles i dont know what to do with and she stands in her tatteredcloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does shewant the money for as if that money could add a hairs breadth tohappiness or peace of mind can anything in the world make her or meless a prey to evil and deathdeath which ends all and must cometoday or tomorrowat any rate in an instant as compared witheternity and again he twisted the screw with the stripped threadand again it turned uselessly in the same placehis servant handed him a halfcut novel in the form of letters bymadame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuousstruggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resisther seducer when she loved him he thought god could not have putinto her heart an impulse that was against his will my wifeas sheonce wasdid not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has beenfound out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself allwe can know is that we know nothing and thats the height of humanwisdomeverything within and around him seemed confused senseless andrepellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierrefound a kind of tantalizing satisfactioni make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for thisgentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by anothertraveler also detained for lack of horsesthe newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled oldman with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinitegrayish colorpierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed thathad been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer whowith a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with theaid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt bootson his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskincoat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head withits broad temples and closecropped hair and looked at bezukhov thestern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre hefelt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up hismind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed hiseyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one ofthem pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing adeaths head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or asit seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servantwas also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustacheevidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grownthis active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen andpreparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything wasready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled atumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whomhe passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and theneed even the inevitability of entering into conversation with thisstrangerthe servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down with anunfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would bewanted to indicate he did not want more teano give me the book said the strangerthe servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional workand the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him all atonce the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and againleaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his formerposition with his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not timeto turn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady andsevere gaze straight on pierres facepierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright oldeyes attracted him irresistiblychapter iii have the pleasure of addressing count bezukhov if i am notmistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voicepierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectaclesi have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger andof your misfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if tosayyes misfortune call it what you please i know that whathappened to you in moscow was a misfortunei regret it verymuch my dear sirpierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bentforward toward the old man with a forced and timid smilei have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but forgreater reasonshe paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by wayof inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctantto enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to himinvoluntarily came up and sat down beside himyou are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued youare young and i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in mypoweroh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very gratefulto you where are you traveling fromthe strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe butin spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance wereirresistibly attractive to pierrebut if for any reason you dont feel inclined to talk to mesaid the old man say so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled inan unexpected and tenderly paternal wayoh no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make youracquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the strangershands he looked more closely at the ring with its skulla masonicsignallow me to ask he said are you a masonyes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said thestranger looking deeper and deeper into pierres eyes and intheir name and my own i hold out a brotherly hand to youi am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between theconfidence the personality of the freemason inspired in him and his ownhabit of ridiculing the masonic beliefsi am afraid i am very farfrom understandinghow am i to put iti am afraid my way of lookingat the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand oneanotheri know your outlook said the mason and the view of life youmention and which you think is the result of your own mental effortsis the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruitof pride indolence and ignorance forgive me my dear sir but if ihad not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is aregrettable delusionjust as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faintsmilei should never dare to say that i know the truth said the masonwhose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmnessno one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stonewith the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from ourforefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to bea worthy dwelling place of the great god he added and closed hiseyesi ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe ingod said pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling itessential to speak the whole truththe mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man withmillions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poorman had not the five rubles that would make him happyyes you do not know him my dear sir said the mason youcannot know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappyyes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i todoyou know him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy you donot know him but he is here he is in me he is in my words he is inthee and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just utteredpronounced the mason in a stern and tremulous voicehe paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himselfif he were not he said quietly you and i would not bespeaking of him my dear sir of what of whom are we speaking whomhast thou denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity andauthority in his voice who invented him if he did not exist whencecame thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible beingdidst thou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of theexistence of such an incomprehensible being a being allpowerfuleternal and infinite in all his attributeshe stopped and remained silent for a long timepierre could not and did not wish to break this silencehe exists but to understand him is hard the mason began againlooking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the leavesof his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keepstill if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt i couldbring him to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee buthow can i an insignificant mortal show his omnipotence his infinityand all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his eyes that he maynot see or understand him and may not see or understand his own vilenessand sinfulness he paused again who art thou thou dreamest thatthou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words hewent on with a somber and scornful smile and thou art more foolishand unreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of askillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not understandits use he does not believe in the master who made it to know him ishard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor toattain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim butin our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and hisgreatnesspierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the masons face withshining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing withhis whole soul what the stranger said whether he accepted the wisereasoning contained in the masons words or believed as a childbelieves in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness orthe tremor of the speakers voicewhich sometimes almost brokeorthose brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calmfirmness and certainty of his vocation which radiated from his wholebeing and which struck pierre especially by contrast with his owndejection and hopelessnessat any rate pierre longed with his wholesoul to believe and he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfortregeneration and return to lifehe is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said themasoni do not understand said pierre feeling with dismay doubtsreawakening he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness inthe masons arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in himi dont understand he said how it is that the mind of mancannot attain the knowledge of which you speakthe mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smilethe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wishto imbibe he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impurevessel and judge of its purity only by the inner purification of myselfcan i retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receiveyes yes that is so said pierre joyfullythe highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on thoseworldly sciences of physics history chemistry and the like intowhich intellectual knowledge is divided the highest wisdom is onethe highest wisdom has but one sciencethe science of the wholethescience explaining the whole creation and mans place in it toreceive that science it is necessary to purify and renew ones innerself and so before one can know it is necessary to believe and toperfect ones self and to attain this end we have the light calledconscience that god has implanted in our soulsyes yes assented pierrelook then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and askthyself whether thou art content with thyself what hast thou attainedrelying on reason only what art thou you are young you are rich youare clever you are well educated and what have you done with all thesegood gifts are you content with yourself and with your lifeno i hate my life pierre muttered wincingthou hatest it then change it purify thyself and as thou artpurified thou wilt gain wisdom look at your life my dear sirhow have you spent it in riotous orgies and debauchery receivingeverything from society and giving nothing in return you have becomethe possessor of wealth how have you used it what have you donefor your neighbor have you ever thought of your tens of thousandsof slaves have you helped them physically and morally no you haveprofited by their toil to lead a profligate life that is what you havedone have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to yourneighbor no you have spent your life in idleness then you married mydear sirtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a youngwoman and what have you done you have not helped her to find the wayof truth my dear sir but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit andmisery a man offended you and you shot him and you say you do notknow god and hate your life there is nothing strange in that my dearsirafter these words the mason as if tired by his long discourse againleaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes pierrelooked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and movedhis lips without uttering a sound he wished to say yes a vileidle vicious life but dared not break the silencethe mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do and called hisservanthow about the horses he asked without looking at pierrethe exchange horses have just come answered the servant willyou not rest hereno tell them to harnesscan he really be going away leaving me alone without having told meall and without promising to help me thought pierre rising withdowncast head and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally atthe mason yes i never thought of it but i have led a contemptibleand profligate life though i did not like it and did not want tothought pierre but this man knows the truth and if he wished tocould disclose it to mepierre wished to say this to the mason but did not dare to thetraveler having packed his things with his practiced hands beganfastening his coat when he had finished he turned to bezukhov andsaid in a tone of indifferent politenesswhere are you going to now my dear siri im going to petersburg answered pierre in a childlikehesitating voice i thank you i agree with all you have said butdo not suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul i wish to be what youwould have me be but i have never had help from anyone but it isi above all who am to blame for everything help me teach me andperhaps i maypierre could not go on he gulped and turned awaythe mason remained silent for a long time evidently consideringhelp comes from god alone he said but such measure of help asour order can bestow it will render you my dear sir you are going topetersburg hand this to count willarski he took out his notebookand wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in fourallow me to give you a piece of advice when you reach the capitalfirst of all devote some time to solitude and selfexamination and donot resume your former way of life and now i wish you a good journeymy dear sir he added seeing that his servant had entered andsuccessthe traveler was joseph alexeevich bazdeev as pierre saw from thepostmasters book bazdeev had been one of the bestknown freemasonsand martinists even in novikovs time for a long while after he hadgone pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and downthe room pondering over his vicious past and with a rapturous senseof beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachablevirtuous future that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he hadbeen vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is tobe virtuous not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul hefirmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united inthe aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue and that is howfreemasonry presented itself to himchapter iiion reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrivalhe went nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas a kempis whosebook had been sent him by someone unknown one thing he continuallyrealized as he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to himof believing in the possibility of attaining perfection and in thepossibility of active brotherly love among men which joseph alexeevichhad revealed to him a week after his arrival the young polish countwillarski whom pierre had known slightly in petersburg society cameinto his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner inwhich dolokhovs second had called on him and having closed thedoor behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in theroom addressed pierrei have come to you with a message and an offer count hesaid without sitting down a person of very high standing in ourbrotherhood has made application for you to be received into our orderbefore the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor iconsider it a sacred duty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wishto enter the brotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorshipthe cold austere tone of this man whom he had almost always before metat balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant womensurprised pierreyes i do wish it said hewillarski bowed his headone more question count he said which i beg you to answerin all sinceritynot as a future mason but as an honest man have yourenounced your former convictionsdo you believe in godpierre consideredyes yes i believe in god he saidin that case began willarski but pierre interrupted himyes i do believe in god he repeatedin that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at yourservicewillarski was silent throughout the drive to pierres inquiries asto what he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied thatbrothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only totell the truthhaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had itsheadquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a smallwelllit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid ofa servant from there they passed into another room a man in strangeattire appeared at the door willarski stepping toward him saidsomething to him in french in an undertone and then went up to a smallwardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seenbefore having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski boundpierres eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching somehairs painfully in the knot then he drew his face down kissed him andtaking him by the hand led him forward the hairs tied in the knot hurtpierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smilehis huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered thoughsmiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid stepshaving led him about ten paces willarski stoppedwhatever happens to you he said you must bear it all manfullyif you have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre noddedaffirmatively when you hear a knock at the door you will uncoveryour eyes added willarski i wish you courage and successand pressing pierres hand he went outleft alone pierre went on smiling in the same way once or twicehe shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as ifwishing to take it off but let it drop again the five minutes spentwith his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour his arms felt numbhis legs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out heexperienced a variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of whatwould happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he feltcurious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed tohim but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when hewould at last start on that path of regeneration and on the activelyvirtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met josephalexeevich loud knocks were heard at the door pierre took the bandageoff his eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darknessonly a small lamp was burning inside something white pierre went nearerand saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open bookthe book was the gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was ahuman skull with its cavities and teeth after reading the first wordsof the gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was withgod pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filledwith something it was a coffin with bones inside he was not at allsurprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new life quiteunlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even moreunusual than what he was seeing a skull a coffin the gospelitseemed to him that he had expected all this and even more tryingto stimulate his emotions he looked around god death love thebrotherhood of man he kept saying to himself associating thesewords with vague yet joyful ideas the door opened and someone came inby the dim light to which pierre had already become accustomed hesaw a rather short man having evidently come from the light into thedarkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward thetable and placed on it his small leathergloved handsthis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest andpart of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a highwhite ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up frombelowfor what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning inpierres direction at a slight rustle made by the latter why haveyou who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have notseen the light come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtueenlightenmentat the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre felt asense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood atconfession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a completestranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with batedbreath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor by which name thebrother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood wasknown drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a man he knewsmolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was anacquaintancehe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructorfor a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had torepeat his questionyes i i desire regeneration pierre uttered withdifficultyvery well said smolyaninov and went on at once have you anyidea of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach youraim said he quietly and quicklyi hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierrewith a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to hisexcitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters inrussianwhat is your conception of freemasonryi imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men whohave virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacyof his words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke iimaginegood said the rhetor quickly apparently satisfied withthis answer have you sought for means of attaining your aim inreligionno i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierreso softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he wassaying i have been an atheist answered pierreyou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your lifetherefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said therhetor after a moments pauseyes yes assented pierrethe rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breastand began to speaknow i must disclose to you the chief aim of our order he saidand if this aim coincides with yours you may enter our brotherhoodwith profit the first and chief object of our order the foundation onwhich it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservationand handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery whichhas come down to us from the remotest ages even from the first manamystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends but since thismystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he beprepared by long and diligent selfpurification not everyone can hopeto attain it quickly hence we have a secondary aim that of preparingour members as much as possible to reform their hearts to purify andenlighten their minds by means handed on to us by tradition from thosewho have striven to attain this mystery and thereby to render themcapable of receiving itby purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improvethe whole human race offering it in our members an example of pietyand virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil whichsways the world think this over and i will come to you againto combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and amental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mindhe imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and headdressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himselfvicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deedimagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the threeobjects mentioned by the rhetor this last that of improving mankindespecially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by therhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essentialand the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did notmuch interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that hewas already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for allthat was goodhalf an hour later the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of theseven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomons templewhich every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were discretion the keeping of the secrets of the order obedience tothose of higher ranks in the order morality love of mankind courage generosity the love of deathin the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death therhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe butas a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtuefrom this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense andpeaceyes that must be so thought pierre when after these words therhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it must be sobut i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which is onlynow gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues whichpierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in hissoul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especiallyobediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he nowfelt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his willto those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventhvirtue was and could not recall itthe third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierrewhether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit toall that would be required of himi am ready for everything said pierrei must also inform you said the rhetor that our orderdelivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means whichmay perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdomand virtue than mere words this chamber with what you see thereinshould already have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more thanwords could do you will perhaps also see in your further initiation alike method of enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societiesthat explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph saidthe rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the sensesbut which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbolpierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak helistened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that hisordeal was about to beginif you are resolved i must begin your initiation said the rhetorcoming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give meall your valuablesbut i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he wasasked to give up all he possessedwhat you have with you watch money ringspierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage forsome time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had beendone the rhetor saidin token of obedience i ask you to undresspierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to therhetors instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierresleft breast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousersto above the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot alsoand was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger thetrouble but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave hima slipper for his left foot with a childlike smile of embarrassmentdoubt and selfderision which appeared on his face against his willpierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before hisbrother rhetor and awaited his further commandsand now in token of candor i ask you to reveal to me your chiefpassion said the lattermy passion i have had so many replied pierrethat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on thepath of virtue said the masonpierre paused seeking a replywine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger womenhe went over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to givethe preeminencewomen he said in a low scarcely audible voicethe mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after thisanswer at last he moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that layon the table again bound his eyesfor the last time i say to youturn all your attention uponyourself put a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not inpassion but in your own heart the source of blessedness is not withoutus but withinpierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing sourceof blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotionchapter ivsoon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre notthe rhetor but pierres sponsor willarski whom he recognized by hisvoice to fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution pierrereplied yes yes i agree and with a beaming childlike smilehis fat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slipperedand one booted foot he advanced while willarski held a sword to hisbare chest he was conducted from that room along passages that turnedbackwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of thelodge willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock withmallets the doors opened before them a bass voice pierre was stillblindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he wasborn and so on then he was again led somewhere still blindfoldedand as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of hispilgrimage of holy friendship of the eternal architect of theuniverse and of the courage with which he should endure toils anddangers during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spokenof now as the seeker now as the sufferer and now as thepostulant to the accompaniment of various knockings withmallets and swords as he was being led up to some object he noticed ahesitation and uncertainty among his conductors he heard those aroundhim disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should beled along a certain carpet after that they took his right hand placedit on something and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his leftbreast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloudan oath of fidelity to the laws of the order the candles were thenextinguished and some spirit lighted as pierre knew by the smell andhe was told that he would now see the lesser light the bandage wastaken off his eyes and by the faint light of the burning spiritpierre as in a dream saw several men standing before him wearingaprons like the rhetors and holding swords in their hands pointed athis breast among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained withblood on seeing this pierre moved forward with his breast toward theswords meaning them to pierce it but the swords were drawn back fromhim and he was at once blindfolded againnow thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then thecandles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light thebandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together sictransit gloria mundipierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the roomand at the people in it round a long table covered with black sat sometwelve men in garments like those he had already seen some of thempierre had met in petersburg society in the presidents chair sat ayoung man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from hisneck on his right sat the italian abbe whom pierre had met atanna pavlovnas two years before there were also present a verydistinguished dignitary and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at thekuragins all maintained a solemn silence listening to the wordsof the president who held a mallet in his hand let into the wall wasa starshaped light at one side of the table was a small carpet withvarious figures worked upon it at the other was something resembling analtar on which lay a testament and a skull round it stood seven largecandlesticks like those used in churches two of the brothers led pierreup to the altar placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie downsaying that he must prostrate himself at the gates of the templehe must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothersoh hush please said anotherpierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes withoutobeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what ami doing arent they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to rememberthis but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced atthe serious faces of those around remembered all he had already gonethrough and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghastat his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feelingprostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really thefeeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before whenhe had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leatherapron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a troweland three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed him hetold him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of thatapron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplainedtrowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from viceand indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to thefirst pair of gloves a mans he said that pierre could not knowtheir meaning but must keep them the second pair of mans gloveshe was to wear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair ofwomens gloves he said dear brother these womans gloves areintended for you too give them to the woman whom you shall honor mostof all this gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whomyou select to be your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pausehe added but beware dear brother that these gloves do not deckhands that are unclean while the grand master said these last wordsit seemed to pierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew stillmore confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes beganlooking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followedthis silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to therug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation ofall the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line atrowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows andso on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs ofthe lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit downthe grand master began reading the statutes they were very long andpierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state tounderstand what was being read he managed to follow only the last wordsof the statutes and these remained in his mindin our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grandmaster but those between virtue and vice beware of making anydistinctions which may infringe equality fly to a brothers aidwhoever he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that fallethnever bear malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteouskindle in all hearts the flame of virtue share thy happiness with thyneighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss forgive thyenemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good thus fulfillingthe highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity whichthou hast losthe finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tearsof joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer thecongratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on allsides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men onlybrothers and burned with impatience to set to work with themthe grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down intheir places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity ofhumilitythe grand master proposed that the last duty should be performedand the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collectorof alms went round to all the brothers pierre would have likedto subscribe all he had but fearing that it might look like pridesubscribed the same amount as the othersthe meeting was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he hadreturned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years hadbecome completely changed and had quite left behind his former habitsand way of lifechapter vthe day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was sitting athome reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the squareone side of which symbolized god another moral things a thirdphysical things and the fourth a combination of these now and thenhis attention wandered from the book and the square and he formed inimagination a new plan of life on the previous evening at the lodge hehad heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that itwould be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre proposed going to hisestates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfshe was joyfully planning this new life when prince vasili suddenlyentered the roommy dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why have youquarreled with helene mon cher you are under a delusion saidprince vasili as he entered i know all about it and i can tellyou positively that helene is as innocent before you as christ wasbefore the jewspierre was about to reply but prince vasili interrupted himand why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend iknow all about it and understand it all he said you behaved asbecomes a man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we wontgo into that but consider the position in which you are placing her andme in the eyes of society and even of the court he added loweringhis voice she is living in moscow and you are here rememberdear boy and he drew pierres arm downwards it is simply amisunderstanding i expect you feel it so yourself let us write hera letter at once and shell come here and all will be explained orelse my dear boy let me tell you its quite likely youll have tosuffer for itprince vasili gave pierre a significant looki know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking akeen interest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious tohelenepierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vasilidid not let him and on the other pierre himself feared to begin tospeak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he hadfirmly resolved to answer his fatherinlaw moreover the words of themasonic statutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him heblinked went red got up and sat down again struggling with himselfto do what was for him the most difficult thing in lifeto say anunpleasant thing to a mans face to say what the other whoeverhe might be did not expect he was so used to submitting to princevasilis tone of careless selfassurance that he felt he would beunable to withstand it now but he also felt that on what he said nowhis future dependedwhether he would follow the same old road or thatnew path so attractively shown him by the masons on which he firmlybelieved he would be reborn to a new lifenow dear boy said prince vasili playfully say yesand ill write to her myself and we will kill the fatted calfbut before prince vasili had finished his playful speech pierrewithout looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like hisfather muttered in a whisperprince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped upand opened the door for himgo he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look ofconfusion and fear that showed itself on prince vasilis facewhats the matter with you are you illgo the quivering voice repeated and prince vasili had to gowithout receiving any explanationa week later pierre having taken leave of his new friends the masonsand leaving large sums of money with them for alms went away to hisestates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and odessa masonsand promised to write to him and guide him in his new activitychapter vithe duel between pierre and dolokhov was hushed up and in spite ofthe emperors severity regarding duels at that time neither theprincipals nor their seconds suffered for it but the story of the duelconfirmed by pierres rupture with his wife was the talk of societypierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he wasan illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the bestmatch in russia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after hismarriagewhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothingto hope from himespecially as he did not know how and did notwish to court societys favor now he alone was blamed for what hadhappened he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like hisfather to fits of bloodthirsty rage and when after pierresdeparture helene returned to petersburg she was received by all heracquaintances not only cordially but even with a shade of deferencedue to her misfortune when conversation turned on her husband heleneassumed a dignified expression which with characteristic tact she hadacquired though she did not understand its significance this expressionsuggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplaininglyand that her husband was a cross laid upon her by god prince vasiliexpressed his opinion more openly he shrugged his shoulders when pierrewas mentioned and pointing to his forehead remarkeda bit touchedi always said soi said from the first declared anna pavlovna referring topierre i said at the time and before anyone else she insistedon her priority that that senseless young man was spoiled by thedepraved ideas of these days i said so even at the time when everybodywas in raptures about him when he had just returned from abroad andwhen if you remember he posed as a sort of marat at one of my soireesand how has it ended i was against this marriage even then and foretoldall that has happenedanna pavlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind ofsoirees as beforesuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingatwhich was to be found the cream of really good society the bloomof the intellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put itbesides this refined selection of society anna pavlovnas receptionswere also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some newand interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was thestate of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg courtsociety so dearly and distinctly indicatedtoward the end of when all the sad details of napoleonsdestruction of the prussian army at jena and auerstadt and thesurrender of most of the prussian fortresses had been received when ourtroops had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleonwas beginning anna pavlovna gave one of her soirees the cream ofreally good society consisted of the fascinating helene forsakenby her husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who hadjust returned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young manreferred to in that drawing room as a man of great merit un hommede beaucoup de merite a newly appointed maid of honor and her motherand several other less noteworthy personsthe novelty anna pavlovna was setting before her guests that eveningwas boris drubetskoy who had just arrived as a special messenger fromthe prussian army and was aidedecamp to a very important personagethe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company thatevening was thiswhatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do tocountenance bonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance andmortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter we shall not ceaseto express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to theking of prussia and others so much the worse for you tu lasvoulu george dandin thats all we have to say about itwhen boris who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawingroom almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guidedby anna pavlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria andthe hope of an alliance with herboris grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and selfpossessedentered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of anaidedecamp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt andthen brought back to the general circleanna pavlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him toseveral persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered descriptionof eachprince hippolyte kuragincharming young fellow mkronqcharge daffaires from copenhagena profound intellectand simply mr shitova man of great meritthis of the manusually so describedthanks to anna mikhaylovnas efforts his own tastes and thepeculiarities of his reserved nature boris had managed during hisservice to place himself very advantageously he was aidedecamp to avery important personage had been sent on a very important mission toprussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger he hadbecome thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he hadbeen so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign might rankincomparably higher than a general and according to which what wasneeded for success in the service was not effort or work or courage orperseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who cangrant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of hissuccess and at the inability of others to understand these thingsin consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life allhis relations with old friends all his plans for his future werecompletely altered he was not rich but would spend his last groat tobe better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of manypleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appearin the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends withand sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position andwho could therefore be of use to him he liked petersburg and despisedmoscow the remembrance of the rostovs house and of his childishlove for natasha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to seethe rostovs since the day of his departure for the army to be in annapavlovnas drawing room he considered an important step up in theservice and he at once understood his role letting his hostess makeuse of whatever interest he had to offer he himself carefully scannedeach face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy witheach of those present and the advantages that might accrue he tookthe seat indicated to him beside the fair helene and listened to thegeneral conversationvienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainablethat not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would securethem and she doubts the means we have of gaining them that is theactual phrase used by the vienna cabinet said the danish chargedaffairesthe doubt is flattering said the man of profound intellectwith a subtle smilewe must distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor ofaustria said mortemart the emperor of austria can never havethought of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says itah my dear vicomte put in anna pavlovna lurope forsome reason she called it urope as if that were a specially refinedfrench pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing witha frenchman lurope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere europe will never be our sincere allyafter that anna pavlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the kingof prussia in order to draw boris into the conversationboris listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his turnbut managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor thebeautiful helene whose eyes several times met those of the handsomeyoung aidedecamp with a smilespeaking of the position of prussia anna pavlovna very naturally askedboris to tell them about his journey to glogau and in what state hefound the prussian army boris speaking with deliberation told themin pure correct french many interesting details about the armies andthe court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of hisown about the facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed thegeneral attention and anna pavlovna felt that the novelty she hadserved up was received with pleasure by all her visitors the greatestattention of all to boris narrative was shown by helene she askedhim several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested inthe state of the prussian army as soon as he had finished she turned tohim with her usual smileyou absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone thatimplied that for certain considerations he could not know of this wasabsolutely necessaryon tuesday between eight and nine it will give me great pleasureboris promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin aconversation with her when anna pavlovna called him away on thepretext that her aunt wished to hear himyou know her husband of course said anna pavlovna closing hereyes and indicating helene with a sorrowful gesture ah she issuch an unfortunate and charming woman dont mention him beforeherplease dont it is too painful for herchapter viiwhen boris and anna pavlovna returned to the others prince hippolytehad the ear of the companybending forward in his armchair he said le roi de prusse andhaving said this laughed everyone turned toward himle roi de prusse hippolyte said interrogatively again laughingand then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna pavlovnawaited for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no moreshe began to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen thesword of frederick the greatit is the sword of frederick the great which i she began buthippolyte interrupted her with the words le roi de prusse andagain as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and said nomoreanna pavlovna frowned mortemart hippolytes friend addressed himfirmlycome now what about your roi de prussehippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughingoh its nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeata joke he had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all thatevening to get in i only wished to say that we are wrong to fightpour le roi de prusseboris smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironicalor appreciative according to the way the joke was received everybodylaughedyour joke is too bad its witty but unjust said annapavlovna shaking her little shriveled finger at himwe are not fighting pour le roi de prusse but for right principlesoh that wicked prince hippolyte she saidthe conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on thepolitical news it became particularly animated toward the end of theevening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentionedyou know n n received a snuffbox with the portrait lastyear said the man of profound intellect why shouldnts s get the same distinctionpardon me a snuffbox with the emperors portrait is a reward butnot a distinction said the diplomatista gift ratherthere are precedents i may mention schwarzenbergits impossible replied anotherwill you bet the ribbon of the order is a different matterwhen everybody rose to go helene who had spoken very little allthe evening again turned to boris asking him in a tone of caressingsignificant command to come to her on tuesdayit is of great importance to me she said turning with a smiletoward anna pavlovna and anna pavlovna with the same sad smile withwhich she spoke of her exalted patroness supported helenes wishit seemed as if from some words boris had spoken that evening about theprussian army helene had suddenly found it necessary to see himshe seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came ontuesdaybut on tuesday evening having come to helenes splendid salonboris received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary forhim to come there were other guests and the countess talked little tohim and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedlyand in a whisper with a strangely unsmiling face come to dinnertomorrow in the evening you must come comeduring that stay in petersburg boris became an intimate in thecountess housechapter viiithe war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier everywhere oneheard curses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind militiamen andrecruits were being enrolled in the

the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chiefthen appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russiadespite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeablesince the time when he thought his son had been killed he did not thinkit right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperorhimself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energyand strength he was continually traveling through the three provincesentrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties severeto cruel with his subordinates and went into everything down to theminutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons inmathematics from her father and when the old prince was at home wentto his study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as hisgrandfather called him the baby prince nicholas lived with his wetnurse and nurse savishna in the late princess rooms and princessmary spent most of the day in the nursery

dandling the little angelas shecalled her nephewand playing with himnear the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over thetomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monumentbrought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready tofly upwards the angels upper lip was slightly raised as thoughabout to smile and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew andprincess mary admitted to one another that the angels face remindedthem strangely of the little princess but what was still strangerthough of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister was that in theexpression the sculptor had happened to give the angels face princeandrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his deadwife ah why have you done this to mesoon after prince andrews return the old prince made over to him alarge estate bogucharovo about twentyfive miles from bald hillspartly because of the depressing memories associated with bald hillspartly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to bearing withhis fathers peculiarities and partly because he needed solitudeprince andrew made use of bogucharovo began building and spent most ofhis time thereafter the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved notto continue his military service and when the war recommencedand everybody had to serve he took a post under his father in therecruitment so as to avoid active service the old prince and his sonseemed to have changed roles since the campaign of the old manroused by activity expected the best results from the new

shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissivelyand calling the nurse began giving the medicine the child screamedhoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching his head went out and satdown on a sofa in the next roomhe still had all the letters in his hand opening them mechanically hebegan reading the old prince now and then using abbreviations wrotein his large elongated hand on blue paper

rejoicingand the rewards sent to the army are innumerable though he is agermani congratulate him i cant make out what the commander atkorchevoa certain khandrikovis up to till now the additionalmen and provisions have not arrived gallop off to him at once andsay ill have his head off if everything is not here in a weekhave received another letter about the preussischeylau battlefrom petenkahe took part in itand its all true whenmischiefmakers dont meddle even a german beats buonaparte he issaid to be fleeing in great disorder mind you gallop off to korchevowithout delay and carry out instructionsprince andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope it wasa closely written letter of two sheets from bilibin he folded it upwithout reading it and reread his fathers letter ending with thewords gallop off to korchevo and carry out instructionsno pardon me i wont go now till the child is better thoughthe going to the door and looking into the nurseryprincess mary was still standing by the cot gently rocking the babyah yes and what else did he say thats unpleasant thoughtprince andrew recalling his fathers letter yes we have gaineda victory over bonaparte just when im not serving yes yes hesalways poking fun at me ah well let him and he began readingbilibins letter which was written in french he read withoutunderstanding half of it read only to forget if but for a moment whathe had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of allelsechapter ixbilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity andthough he wrote in french and used french jests and french idiomshe described the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensure andselfderision genuinely russian bilibin wrote that the obligation ofdiplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in princeandrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile hehad accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the armythe letter was old having been written before the battle atpreussischeylausince the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrotebilibin as you know my dear prince i never leave headquarters ihave certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for mewhat i have seen during these last three months is incrediblei begin ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you knowattacks the prussians the prussians are our faithful allies who haveonly betrayed us three times in three years we take up their cause butit turns out that the enemy of the human race pays no heed toour fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on theprussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begunand in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installshimself in the palace at potsdami most ardently desire writes the king of prussia tobonaparte that your majesty should be received and treated in mypalace in a manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstancesallowed i have hastened to take all steps to that end may i havesucceeded the prussian generals pride themselves on being polite tothe french and lay down their arms at the first demandthe head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks theking of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender allthis is absolutely truein short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitudeit turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is morein war on our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we haveeverything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namelya commander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz successmight have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been soyoung all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorovskiand kamenski the latter was preferred the general comes to ussuvorovlike in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joyand triumphon the th the first courier arrives from petersburg the mailsare taken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everythinghimself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meantfor us the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressedto him we search but none are to be found the field marshal growsimpatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperorto count t prince v and others then he bursts into one of his wildfuries and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opensthem and reads those from the emperor addressed to others ah sothats the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keepan eye on me very well then get along with you so he writes thefamous order of the day to general bennigseni am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command thearmy you have brought your army corps to pultusk routed here it isexposed and without fuel or forage so something must be done and asyou yourself reported to count buxhowden yesterday you must think ofretreating to our frontierwhich do todayfrom all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got asaddle sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite preventsmy riding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed on thecommand to the general next in seniority count buxhowden having senthim my whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there isa lack of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for onlyone days ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at allas reported by the division commanders ostermann and sedmoretzki andall that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain inhospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humblysubmit my report with the information that if the army remains in itspresent bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man leftin it by springgrant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who isalready in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great andglorious task for which he was chosen i shall await your most graciouspermission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of asecretary rather than commander in the army my removal from the armydoes not produce the slightest stira blind man has left it there arethousands such as i in russiathe field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us allisnt it logicalthis is the first act those that follow are naturally increasinglyinteresting and entertaining after the field marshals departureit appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battlebuxhowden is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsendoes not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps whoare within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunityto fight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he does sothis is the battle of pultusk which is considered a great victory butin my opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know havea very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those whoretreat after a battle have lost it is what we say and according tothat it is we who lost the battle of pultusk in short we retreatafter the battle but send a courier to petersburg with news of avictory and general bennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg thepost of commander in chief as a reward for his victory does not give upthe command of the army to general buxhowden during this interregnumwe begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers our aim isno longer as it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely toavoid general buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chiefso energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordableriver we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who atthe moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general buxhowden was allbut attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of oneof these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhowden pursuesuswe scuttle he hardly crosses the river to our side before werecross to the other at last our enemy buxhowden catches us andattacks both generals are angry and the result is a challenge onbuxhowdens part and an epileptic fit on bennigsens but at thecritical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory atpultusk to petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander inchief and our first foe buxhowden is vanquished we can now turnour thoughts to the second bonaparte but as it turns out just atthat moment a third enemy rises before usnamely the orthodox russiansoldiers loudly demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnotthe stores are empty the roads impassable the orthodox begin lootingand in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea half theregiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everythingto fire and sword the inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitalsoverflow with sick and famine is everywhere twice the marauders evenattack our headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for abattalion to disperse them during one of these attacks they carried offmy empty portmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to giveall commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i muchfear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the otherat first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a whilein spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trustbilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more when hehad read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it wasnot what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life outthere in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyesrubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what hehad read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly hethought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized withalarm lest something should have happened to the child while he wasreading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened itjust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from himwith a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cotmy dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behindhimas often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he wasseized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child wasdead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terrorall is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on hisforehead he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find itempty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew thecurtain aside and for some time his frightened restless eyes could notfind the baby at last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till helay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smackinghis lips in his sleep and breathing evenlyprince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he hadalready lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught himtried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the softforehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand eventhe hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not deadbut evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent prince andrewlonged to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helplesslittle creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at hishead and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket heheard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain ofthe cot he did not look round but still gazing at the infants facelistened to his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess marywho had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtainand dropped it again behind her prince andrew recognized her withoutlooking and held out his hand to her she pressed ithe has perspired said prince andrewi was coming to tell you sothe child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his foreheadagainst the pillowprince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain herluminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy thatwere in them she leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightlycatching the curtain of the cot each made the other a warning gestureand stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishingto leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all theworld prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hairagainst the muslin of the curtainyes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sighchapter xsoon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to thekiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking withhim full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as towhat he should do on his estateswhen he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head officeand explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that stepswould be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then theywere not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babieswere not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfspunishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitalsasylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some ofthe stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened withalarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeasedwith their management and embezzlement of money some after their firstfright were amused by pierres lisp and the new words they had notheard before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked whilethe cleverest among them including the chief steward understood fromthis speech how they could best handle the master for their own endsthe chief steward expressed great sympathy with pierres intentionsbut remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go intothe general state of affairs which was far from satisfactorydespite count bezukhovs enormous wealth since he had come into anincome which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a yearpierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made himan allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of thefollowing budgetabout went in payments on all the estates to the land bank about went for the upkeep of the estate near moscow the town houseand the allowance to the three princesses about was given inpensions and the same amount for asylums alimony was sent tothe countess about went for interest on debts the building of anew church previously begun had cost about in each of the lasttwo years and he did not know how the rest about rubles wasspent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow besides this thechief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvestsor of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops so the firsttask pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude orinclinationpractical businesshe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward buthe felt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that theseconsultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up withthem or make them move on the one hand the chief steward put the stateof things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity ofpaying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf laborto which pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded thatsteps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met byshowing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the land bankand the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipationthe steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested sellingthe forests in the province of kostroma the land lower down the riverand the crimean estate in order to make it possible all of whichoperations according to him were connected with such complicatedmeasuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and soonthat pierre became quite bewildered and only repliedyes yes do sopierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled himto attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only triedto pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the stewardfor his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered theseconsultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome tohimselfin kiev pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to makehis acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer thelargest landowner of the province temptations to pierres greatestweaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to thelodgewere so strong that he could not resist them again whole daysweeks and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as muchoccupied with evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving himno time for reflection as in petersburg instead of the new life he hadhoped to lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundingsof the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did notfulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of morallife and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and thelove of death he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilledanother of the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand hadother virtueslove of his neighbor and especially generosityin the spring of he decided to return to petersburg on the way heintended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his ordershad been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom god hadentrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefitthe chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almostinsaneunprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfsmadesome concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfsas impracticable he arranged for the erection of largebuildingsschools hospitals and asylumson all the estatesbefore the master arrived everywhere preparations were made not forceremonious welcomes which he knew pierre would not like but for justsuch gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the breadand salt of hospitality as according to his understanding of hismaster would touch and delude himthe southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a viennacarriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect onpierre the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesquethan the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchinglygrateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptionswhich though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in thedepth of his heart in one place the peasants presented him with breadand salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul asking permissionas a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on themto build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honorof peter and paul his patron saints in another place the women withinfants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hardwork on a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meethim surrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he wasinstructing in reading writing and religion on all his estates pierresaw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erectionall on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soonto be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according towhich the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard thetouching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted bluecoatswhat pierre did not know was that the place where they presented himwith bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter andpaul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters dayand that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begunthe chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in thatvillages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know thatsince the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land theydid still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priestwho met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions andthat the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their childrenand secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that thebrick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manoriallabor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not knowthat where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfspayments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial workhad been increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visitto his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in whichhe had left petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to hisbrotherinstructor as he called the grand masterhow easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much goodthought pierre and how little attention we pay to ithe was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed atreceiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might dofor these simple kindly peoplethe chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectlythrough the naive and intelligent count and played with him as witha toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierrepressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above allthe uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it waspierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would bedifficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what wouldhappen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantlyon what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power tocarry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would thecount never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken forthe sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bankbut would probably never even inquire and would never know that thenewly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continuedto give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat isto say all that could be got out of themchapter xireturning from his journey through south russia in the happiest stateof mind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting hisfriend bolkonski whom he had not seen for two yearsbogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country amongfields and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down thehouse lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink andwith banks still bare of grass it was at the end of a village thatstretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which werea few fir treesthe homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables abathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facadestill in course of construction round the house was a garden newly laidout the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and awater cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straightthe bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress oftidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in replyto inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newlybuilt lodge close to the pond anton a man who had looked after princeandrew in his boyhood helped pierre out of his carriage said that theprince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroompierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house afterthe brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend inpetersburghe quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplasteredwooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but antonran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a doorwell what is it came a sharp unpleasant voicea visitor answered antonask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushedbackpierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face toface with prince andrew who came out frowning and looking old pierreembraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheekand looked at him closelywell i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrewpierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise hewas struck by the change in him his words were kindly and there was asmile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and inspite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyousand glad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and moremanlylooking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got usedto it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolongedconcentration on some one thoughtas is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separationit was long before their conversation could settle on anything theyput questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought tobe talked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled onsome of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plansfor the future pierres journeys and occupations the war and soon the preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in hisfriends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smilewith which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyfulanimation of the past or the future it was as if prince andrew wouldhave liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could notthe latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of hisenthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in princeandrews presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic viewswhich had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tourhe checked himself fearing to seem naive yet he felt an irresistibledesire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quitedifferent and better pierre than he had been in petersburgi cant tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardlyknow myself againyes we have altered much very much since then said princeandrewwell and you what are your plansplans repeated prince andrew ironically my plans he saidas if astonished at the word well you see im building i meanto settle here altogether next yearpierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrews facewhich had grown much olderno i meant to ask pierre began but prince andrew interruptedhimbut why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your travelsand all you have been doing on your estatespierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as faras possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had beenmade prince andrew several times prompted pierres story of what hehad been doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listenednot only without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre wastelling himpierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends companyand at last became silentill tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew whoevidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor i amonly bivouacking here and have just come to look round i am going backto my sister today i will introduce you to her but of course you knowher already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor withwhom he now found nothing in common we will go after dinner andwould you now like to look round my placethey went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the politicalnews and common acquaintances like people who do not know each otherintimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only ofthe new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even herewhile on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the futurearrangements of the house he interrupted himselfhowever this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and thenwell set offat dinner conversation turned on pierres marriagei was very much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrewpierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and saidhurriedly i will tell you some time how it all happened but youknow it is all over and foreverforever said prince andrew nothings foreverbut you know how it all ended dont you you heard of the dueland so you had to go through that tooone thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man saidpierrewhy so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dog is a verygood thing reallyno to kill a man is badwrongwhy is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to manto know what is right and what is wrong men always did and always willerr and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrongwhat does harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling withpleasure that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew wasroused had begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him tohis present stateand who has told you what is bad for another man he askedbad bad exclaimed pierre we all know what is bad forourselvesyes we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself issomething i cannot inflict on others said prince andrew growingmore and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlookto pierre he spoke in french i only know two very real evils inlife remorse and illness the only good is the absence of those evilsto live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophynowand love of ones neighbor and selfsacrifice began pierreno i cant agree with you to live only so as not to do evil andnot to have to repent is not enough i lived like that i lived formyself and ruined my life and only now when i am living or at leasttrying pierres modesty made him correct himself to live forothers only now have i understood all the happiness of life no ishall not agree with you and you do not really believe what you aresaying prince andrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smilewhen you see my sister princess mary youll get on with herhe said perhaps you are right for yourself he added aftera short pause but everyone lives in his own way you lived foryourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happinesswhen you began living for others i experienced just the reverse ilived for gloryand after all what is glory the same love of othersa desire to do something for them a desire for their approvalso ilived for others and not almost but quite ruined my life and i havebecome calmer since i began to live only for myselfbut what do you mean by living only for yourself asked pierregrowing excited what about your son your sister and yourfatherbut thats just the same as myselfthey are not othersexplained prince andrew the others ones neighbors le prochainas you and princess mary call it are the chief source of all error andevil le prochainyour kiev peasants to whom you want to do goodand he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression heevidently wished to draw him onyou are joking replied pierre growing more and more excitedwhat error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and evendoing a littlethough i did very little and did it very badly whatevil can there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people likeourselves were growing up and dying with no idea of god and truthbeyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed ina comforting belief in future life retribution recompense andconsolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dyingof disease without help while material assistance could so easily berendered and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylumfor the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if apeasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and i givethem rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping andi have done that though badly and to a small extent but i have donesomething toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a goodaction and more than that you cant make me believe that you do notthink so yourself and the main thing is he continued that iknow and know for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is theonly sure happiness in lifeyes if you put it like that its quite a different matter saidprince andrew i build a house and lay out a garden and you buildhospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but whatsright and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not byus well you want an argument he added come on thenthey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which servedas a verandacome lets argue then said prince andrew you talk ofschools he went on crooking a finger education and so forththat is you want to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed bythem taking off his cap from his animal condition and awaken in himspiritual needs while it seems to me that animal happiness is the onlyhappiness possible and that is just what you want to deprive him ofi envy him but you want to make him what i am without giving him mymeans then you say lighten his toil but as i see it physicallabor is as essential to him as much a condition of his existence asmental activity is to you or me you cant help thinking i go to bedafter two in the morning thoughts come and i cant sleep but tossabout till dawn because i think and cant help thinking just ashe cant help plowing and mowing if he didnt he would go to thedrink shop or fall ill just as i could not stand his terrible physicallabor but should die of it in a week so he could not stand my physicalidleness but would grow fat and die the third thingwhat else wasit you talked about and prince andrew crooked a third finger ahyes hospitals medicine he has a fit he is dying and you come andbleed him and patch him up he will drag about as a cripple a burden toeverybody for another ten years it would be far easier and simpler forhim to die others are being born and there are plenty of them as it isit would be different if you grudged losing a laborerthats how iregard himbut you want to cure him from love of him and he does notwant that and besides what a notion that medicine ever cured anyonekilled them yes said he frowning angrily and turning away frompierreprince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it wasevident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spokereadily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time hisglance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopelessoh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dontunderstand how one can live with such ideas i had such momentsmyself not long ago in moscow and when traveling but at such times icollapsed so that i dont live at alleverything seems hateful tome myself most of all then i dont eat dont wash and how isit with youwhy not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on thecontrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possibleim alive that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best ican without hurting othersbut with such ideas what motive have you for living one would sitwithout moving undertaking nothinglife as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to donothing but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me thehonor to choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to getout of it they could not understand that i have not the necessaryqualifications for itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallownessnecessary for the position then theres this house which must bebuilt in order to have a nook of ones own in which to be quiet andnow theres this recruitingwhy arent you serving in the armyafter austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no thank youvery much i have promised myself not to serve again in the activerussian army and i wontnot even if bonaparte were here atsmolensk threatening bald hillseven then i wouldnt serve in therussian army well as i was saying he continued recovering hiscomposure now theres this recruiting my father is chief incommand of the third district and my only way of avoiding activeservice is to serve under himthen you are servingi amhe paused a little whileand why do you servewhy for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men ofhis time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has tooenergetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he isterrible and now he has this authority of a commander in chief ofthe recruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two hours latea fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at yukhnovnahanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving becausei alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save himfrom actions which would torment him afterwardswell there you seeyes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued idid not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerkwho had stolen some boots from the recruits i should even have beenvery glad to see him hanged but i was sorry for my fatherthat againis for myselfprince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered feverishlywhile he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was nodesire to do good to his neighborthere now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued thatis a very good thing but not for youi dont suppose you ever hadanyone flogged or sent to siberiaand still less for your serfs ifthey are beaten flogged or sent to siberia i dont suppose they areany the worse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and thestripes on their bodies heal and they are happy as before but it isa good thing for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse uponthemselves stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of beingable to inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people ipity and for their sake i should like to liberate the serfs youmay not have seen but i have seen how good men brought up in thosetraditions of unlimited power in time when they grow more irritablebecome cruel and harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrainthemselves and grow more and more miserableprince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinkingthat these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by hisfathers casehe did not replyso thats what im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mindpurity and not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shaveas you may always remain the same backs and foreheadsno no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you saidpierrechapter xiiin the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove tobald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now andthen with remarks which showed that he was in a good temperpointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making inhis husbandrypierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables andapparently immersed in his own thoughtshe was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did notsee the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten andraise him but as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt thatprince andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teachingand he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridiculewhat to him was precious and sacredno but why do you think so pierre suddenly began lowering hishead and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think soyou should not think sothink what about asked prince andrew with surpriseabout life about mans destiny it cant be so i myself thoughtlike that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dontsmile freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thoughtit was freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternalaspects of humanityand he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to princeandrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freedfrom the bonds of state and church a teaching of equality brotherhoodand loveonly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the restis a dream said pierre understand my dear fellow that outsidethis union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with youthat nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live outhis life like you merely trying not to harm others but make ourfundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself upto us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as ihave felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning ofwhich is hidden in heaven said pierreprince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence topierres words more than once when the noise of the wheels preventedhis catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by thepeculiar glow that came into prince andrews eyes and by his silencepierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew wouldnot interrupt him or laugh at what he saidthey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had tocross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on itthey also stepped on the raftprince andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently atthe flooding waters glittering in the setting sunwell what do you think about it pierre asked why are yousilentwhat do i think about it i am listening to you its all verywell you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim oflife the destiny of man and the laws which govern the world but whoare we men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see whatyou see you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i dontsee itpierre interrupted himdo you believe in a future life he askeda future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him notime to reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as heknew prince andrews former atheistic convictionsyou say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth norcould i and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the endof everything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed tothe fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in theuniverse in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we whoare now the children of earth areeternallychildren of thewhole universe dont i feel in my soul that i am part of this vastharmonious whole dont i feel that i form one link one step betweenthe lower and higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude ofbeings in whom the deitythe supreme power if you prefer the termismanifest if i see clearly see that ladder leading from plant to manwhy should i suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther andfarther i feel that i cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in thisworld but that i shall always exist and always have existed i feelthat beyond me and above me there are spirits and that in this worldthere is truthyes that is herders theory said prince andrew but it isnot that which can convince me dear friendlife and death are whatconvince what convinces is when one sees a being dear to one boundup with ones own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped tomake it right prince andrews voice trembled and he turned awayand suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and ceases toexist why it cannot be that there is no answer and i believe thereis thats what convinces that is what has convinced me saidprince andrewyes yes of course said pierre isnt that what imsayingno all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of thenecessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand withsomeone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere andyou yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have lookedinwell thats it then you know that there is a there and there is asomeone there is the future life the someone isgodprince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long since beentaken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed the sun had sunk halfbelow the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles nearthe ferry but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmencoachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talkedif there is a god and future life there is truth and good andmans highest happiness consists in striving to attain them we mustlive we must love and we must believe that we live not only today onthis scrap of earth but have lived and shall live forever there inthe whole said pierre and he pointed to the skyprince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening topierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of thesun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierrebecame silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of thecurrent beat softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the soundof the waves kept up a refrain to pierres words whisperingit is true believe ithe sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look atpierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superiorfriendyes if it only were so said prince andrew however it istime to get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked upat the sky to which pierre had pointed and for the first time sinceausterlitz saw that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying onthat battlefield and something that had long been slumbering somethingthat was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in hissoul it vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditionsof his life but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how todevelop existed within him his meeting with pierre formed an epoch inprince andrews life though outwardly he continued to live in thesame old way inwardly he began a new lifechapter xiiiit was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the frontentrance of the house at bald hills as they approached the houseprince andrew with a smile drew pierres attention to a commotiongoing on at the back porch a woman bent with age with a wallet on herback and a short longhaired young man in a black garment had rushedback to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up two women ran outafter them and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismayup the steps of the back porchthose are marys gods folk said prince andrew theyhave mistaken us for my father this is the one matter in which shedisobeys him he orders these pilgrims to be driven away but shereceives thembut what are gods folk asked pierreprince andrew had no time to answer the servants came out to meet themand he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected backsoonthe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minuteprince andrew led pierre to his own apartments which were always keptin perfect order and readiness for him in his fathers house hehimself went to the nurserylet us go and see my sister he said to pierre when he returnedi have not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with hergods folk it will serve her right she will be confused butyou will see her gods folk its really very curiouswhat are gods folk asked pierrecome and youll see for yourselfprincess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her facewhen they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before the iconstand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monkscassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar near them in anarmchair sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression onher childlike faceandrew why didnt you warn me said the princess with mildreproach as she stood before her

herpelageya stopped doubtfully but in pierres face there was such alook of sincere penitence and prince andrew glanced so meekly now ather and now at pierre that she was gradually reassuredchapter xivthe pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged to talk gave along account of father amphilochus who led so holy a life that hishands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some monksshe knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she takingsome dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs withthe saints id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on toanother id sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics andthere was such peace all around such blessedness that one dont wantto come out even into the light of heaven againpierre listened to

can weep away our sorrowshe keeps it all within him today he is cheerful and in good spiritsbut that is the effect of your visithe is not often like that ifyou could persuade him to go abroad he needs activity and this quietregular life is very bad for him others dont notice it but i seeittoward ten oclock the men servants rushed to the front door hearingthe bells of the old princes carriage approaching prince andrew andpierre also went out into the porchwhos that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got outof the carriageah very glad kiss me he said having learned who the youngstranger wasthe old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierrebefore supper prince andrew coming back to his fathers study foundhim disputing hotly with his visitor pierre was maintaining that a timewould come when there would be no more wars the old prince disputed itchaffingly but without getting angrydrain the blood from mens veins and put in water instead thenthere will be no more war old womens nonsenseold womensnonsense he repeated but still he patted pierre affectionatelyon the shoulder and then went up to the table where prince andrewevidently not wishing to join in the conversation was looking over thepapers his father had brought from town the old prince went up to himand began to talk businessthe marshal a count rostov hasnt sent half his contingent hecame to town and wanted to invite me to dinneri gave him a prettydinner and there look at this well my boy the old princewent on addressing his son and patting pierre on the shoulder afine fellowyour

supper well have another dispute makefriends with my little fool princess mary he shouted after pierrethrough the dooronly now on his visit to bald hills did pierre fully realize thestrength and charm of his friendship with prince andrew that charm wasnot expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his familyand with the household with the stern old prince and the gentle timidprincess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once feltlike an old friend they were all fond of him already not only princessmary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him hermost radiant looks but even the oneyearold prince nicholas ashis grandfather called him smiled at pierre and let himself be takenin his arms and michael ivanovich and mademoiselle bourienne looked athim with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old princethe old prince came in to supper this was evidently on pierresaccount and during the two days of the young mans visit he wasextremely kind to him and told him to visit them againwhen pierre had gone and the members of the household met together theybegan to express their opinions of him as people always do after a newacquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything butwhat was good of himchapter xvwhen returning from his leave rostov felt for the first time howclose was the bond that united him to denisov and the whole regimenton approaching it rostov felt as he had done when approaching his homein moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniformof his regiment when he recognized redhaired dementyev and saw thepicket ropes of the roan horses when lavrushka gleefully shouted tohis master the count has come and denisov who had been asleepon his bed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace himand the officers collected round to greet the new arrival rostovexperienced the same feeling as when his mother his father and hissister had embraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he couldnot speak the regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear andprecious as his parents housewhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and hadbeen reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had goneout foraging when he had again entered into all the little interestsof the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in onenarrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace ofmoral support and the same sense of being at home here in his ownplace as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none ofall that turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his rightplace and took mistaken decisions here was no sonya with whom heought or ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility ofgoing there or not going there here there were not twentyfour hoursin the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was notthat innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him orfarther from him than another there were none of those uncertain andundefined money relations with his father and nothing to recall thatterrible loss to dolokhov here in the regiment all was clear andsimple the whole world was divided into two unequal parts one ourpavlograd regiment the other all the rest and the rest was noconcern of his in the regiment everything was definite who waslieutenant who captain who was a good fellow who a bad one and mostof all who was a comrade the canteenkeeper gave one credit onespay came every four months there was nothing to think out or decideyou had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the pavlogradregiment and when given an order to do what was clearly distinctlyand definitely orderedand all would be wellhaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimentallife rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down torest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanterfor him because after his loss to dolokhov for which in spiteof all his familys efforts to console him he could not forgivehimself he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by servingnot as he had done before but really well and by being a perfectlyfirstrate comrade and officerin a word a splendid man altogether athing which seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in theregimentafter his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parentsin five years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolvedto take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to hisparentsour army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultuskand preussischeylau was concentrated near bartenstein it was awaitingthe emperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaignthe pavlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which hadserved in the campaign had been recruiting up to strength inrussia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of thecampaign it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussischeylau andwhen it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaignwas attached to platovs divisionplatovs division was acting independently of the main army severaltimes parts of the pavlograd regiment had exchanged shots withthe enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshaloudinots carriages in april the pavlograds were stationed immovablyfor some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german villagea thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river brokeand the roads became impassable for days neither provisions for themen nor fodder for the horses had been issued as no transports couldarrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villagessearching for potatoes but found few even of theseeverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledif anyremained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be takenfrom them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of takinganything from them often gave them the last of their rationsthe pavlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but hadlost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness in the hospitalsdeath was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swellingthat came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly ableto drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitalswhen spring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of theground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they calledmashkas sweet root it was very bitter but they wanderedabout the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate itthough they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant thatspring a new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of thearms legs and face which the doctors attributed to eating this rootbut in spite of all this the soldiers of denisovs squadron fedchiefly on mashkas sweet root because it was the second weekthat the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half apound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozenthe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatchedroofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts offelty winter hairdespite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living justas usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms thehussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed theirhorses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs inplace of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from whichthey rose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger asusual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves beforethem naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes toldand listened to stories of potemkins and suvorovs campaigns orto legends of alesha the sly or the priests laborer mikolkathe officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the rooflesshalfruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes andin general food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves asbefore some playing cards there was plenty of money though there wasno food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittlesthe general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly becausenothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vaguefeeling that in the main it was going badlyrostov lived as before with denisov and since their furlough theyhad become more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostovsfamily but by the tender friendship his commander showed him rostovfelt that the elder hussars luckless love for natasha played a partin strengthening their friendship denisov evidently tried to exposerostov to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted hissafe return with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions ina deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search ofprovisions rostov found a family consisting of an old pole and hisdaughter with an infant in arms they were half clad hungry too weakto get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance rostovbrought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging andkept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering one of hiscomrades talking of women began chaffing rostov saying that he wasmore wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if heintroduced to them the pretty polish girl he had saved rostov tookthe joke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to theofficer that it was all denisov could do to prevent a duel whenthe officer had gone away denisov who did not himself know whatrostovs relations with the polish girl might be began to upbraidhim for his quickness of temper and rostov repliedsay what you like she is like a sister to me and i cant tellyou how it offended me because well for that reasondenisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the roomwithout looking at rostov as was his way at moments of deep feelingah what a mad bweed you wostovs are he muttered and rostovnoticed tears in his eyeschapter xviin april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperors arrivalbut rostov had no chance of being present at the review he held atbartenstein as the pavlograds were at the outposts far beyond thatplacethey were bivouacking denisov and rostov were living in an earth hutdug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf thehut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue atrench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deepand eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out andthese formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the roomin which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a boardlying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table oneach side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about twoand a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roofwas so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trenchand could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the tabledenisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of hissquadron liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther endwith a piece of broken but mended glass in it for a window when itwas very cold embers from the soldiers campfire were placed ona bent sheet of iron on the steps in the reception roomasdenisov called that part of the hutand it was then so warm that theofficers of whom there were always some with denisov and rostov satin their shirt sleevesin april rostov was on orderly duty one morning between seven andeight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changedhis rainsoaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warmthen tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner andhis face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but hisshirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he waspleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few daysfor his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov whohad gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talksuddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hutevidently much excited rostov moved to the window to see whom he wasspeaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenkoi ordered you not to let them eat that mashka woot stuffdenisov was shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchukbwought some fwom the fieldsi have given the order again and again your honor but they dontobey answered the quartermasterrostov lay down again on his bed and thought complacently lethim fuss and bustle now my jobs done and im lyingdowncapitally he could hear that lavrushkathat sly boldorderly of denisovswas talking as well as the quartermasterlavrushka was saying something about loaded wagons biscuits and oxenhe had seen when he had gone out for provisionsthen denisovs voice was heard shouting farther and farther awaysaddle second platoonwhere are they off to now thought rostovfive minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy bootson the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about tookhis leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer torostovs inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crosslythat he had some businesslet god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisovgoing out and rostov heard the hoofs of several horses splashingthrough the mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov hadgone having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leavethe hut till toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weatherhad cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet wereplaying svayka laughing as they threw their missiles which buriedthemselves in the soft mud rostov joined them in the middle of thegame the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars ontheir skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drewup to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded themthere now denisov has been worrying said rostov and hereare the provisionsso they are said the officers wont the soldiers beglada little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantryofficers with whom he was talkingrostov went to meet themi warn you captain one of the officers a short thin manevidently very angry was sayinghavent i told you i wont give

devil quick mach while youre safe and sound anddenisov turned his horse on the officervery well very well muttered the officer threateningly andturning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddlea dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouteddenisov after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman canaddress to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rostov he burst outlaughingive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he saidafter all cant let our men starvethe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to aninfantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transportwas unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force thesoldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even sharedthem with the other squadronsthe next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding hisfingers spread out before his eyes saidthis is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it andwont begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staffand settle the business there in the commissariat department and ifpossible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not asthe demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a rowand the affair may end badlyfrom the regimental commanders denisov rode straight to the staffwith a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he cameback to his dugout in a state such as rostov had never yet seen him indenisov could not speak and gasped for breath when rostov asked whatwas the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in ahoarse feeble voicealarmed at denisovs condition rostov suggested that he shouldundress drink some water and send for the doctortwy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me butill always thwash scoundwels and ill tell the empewoice he mutteredthe regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessaryto bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairyarm and

go to the commissioner i enterand at the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is itthats starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with thefist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke downand the tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so itsyou whos starving us to death is it take this and this and ihit him so pat stwaight on his snout ah what a what aand i stated fwashing him well ive had a bit of fun i can tellyou cried denisov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth showingunder his black mustache id have killed him if they hadnttaken him awaybut what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostovyouve set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it upagaindenisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm andcheerfulbut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostovs anddenisovs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showedthem a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commanderin which inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence theadjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very badturn that a courtmartial had been appointed and that in view of theseverity with which marauding and insubordination were now regardeddegradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped forthe case as represented by the offended parties was that afterseizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chiefquartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatenedto strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and giventwo officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of themin answer to rostovs renewed questions denisov said laughingthat he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed upin it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in theleast fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attackhim he would give them an answer that they would not easily forgetdenisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew himtoo well not to detect that while hiding it from others at hearthe feared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair which wasevidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and noticesfrom the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was orderedto hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear beforethe staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariatoffice on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossackregiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rodeout in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired bya french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps atanother time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight awound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearingat the staff and went into hospitalchapter xviiin june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pavlograds didnot take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostov whofelt his friends absence very much having no news of him since heleft and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of hisaffairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisovin hospitalthe hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastatedby russian and french troops because it was summer when it is sobeautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularlydismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streetstattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering aboutthe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames andpanes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fencethat had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with paleswollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in theyarddirectly rostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell ofputrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian armydoctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistanti cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come tomakar alexeevich in the evening i shall be therethe assistant asked some further questionsoh do the best you can isnt it all the same the doctornoticed rostov coming upstairswhat do you want sir said the doctor what do you wantthe bullets

doctors havedied in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a weeksaid the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have beeninvited here but our allies dont like it at allrostov explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussarswho was woundedi dont know i cant tell you sir only think i am alone incharge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients itswell that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffeeand some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed fourhundred sir and theyre always sending me fresh ones there are

atmollitendead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone ofindifferencethe assistant however did not confirm the doctors wordsis he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctorrostov described denisovs appearancethere was one like that said the doctor as if pleased thatone is dead i fancy however ill look up our list we had a listhave you got it makeevmakar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but ifyoull step into the officers wards youll see for yourselfhe added turning to rostovah youd better not go sir said the doctor or you mayhave to stay here yourselfbut rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistantto show him the wayonly dont blame me the doctor shouted up after himrostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was sostrong there that rostov held his nose and had to pause and collecthis strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and anemaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limpedout and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering enviouseyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostovsaw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw andovercoatsmay i go in and lookwhat is there to see said the assistantbut just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go inrostov entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he hadalready begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here itwas a little different more pungent and one felt that this was whereit originatedin the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windowsthe sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls andleaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious andpaid no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raisedthemselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently atrostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach andenvy of anothers health rostov went to the middle of the room andlooking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the samething there he stood still looking silently around he had not at allexpected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of thepassage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judgeby the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legsoutstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so thatonly the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which werestill red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back ofhis head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he keptrepeating rostov listened and made out the word it was drinkdrink a drink rostov glanced round looking for someone who wouldput this man back in his place and bring him waterwho looks after the sick here he asked the assistantjust then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from thenext room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostovgood day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov andevidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authoritiesget him to his place and give him some water said rostovpointing to the cossackyes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rollinghis eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did notmoveno its impossible to do anything here thought rostovlowering his eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intenselook fixed on him on his right and he turned close to the corner onan overcoat sat an old unshaven graybearded soldier as thin as askeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostovthe mans neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointingat rostov who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him he drewnearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him theother had been amputated above the knee his neighbor on the other sidewho lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back wasa young soldier with a snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckledand his eyes were rolled back rostov looked at the young soldier and acold chill ran down his backwhy this one seems he began turning to the assistantand how weve been begging your honor said the old soldierhis jaw quivering hes been dead since morning after all weremen not dogsill send someone at once he shall be taken awaytaken away atonce said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honoryes yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering hiseyes and shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows ofreproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of theroomchapter xviiigoing along the corridor the assistant led rostov to the officerswards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open therewere beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying orsitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressinggowns the first person rostov met in the officers ward was a thinlittle man with one arm who was walking about the first room in anightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teethrostov looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him beforesee where weve met again said the little man tushintushin dont you remember who gave you a lift at schon grabernand ive had a bit cut off you see he went on with a smilepointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown looking forvasili dmitrich denisov my neighbor he added when he heardwho rostov wanted here here and tushin led him into the nextroom from whence came sounds of several laughing voiceshow can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostovstill aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strongin the soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him thoseenvious looks which had followed him out from both sides and the faceof that young soldier with eyes rolled backdenisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket thoughit was nearly noonah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in thesame voice as in the regiment but rostov noticed sadly that under thishabitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showeditself in the expression of denisovs face and the intonations of hisvoicehis wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeksafter he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the facesof the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostovwhat struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him andsmiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor aboutthe general state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these mattersdid not listenrostov even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of theregiment or in general of that other free life which was going onoutside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life andwas only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers onrostovs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced fromunder his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and therough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he beganreading his paper and specially drew rostovs attention to thestinging rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companionswho had gathered round rostova fresh arrival from the worldoutsidegradually began to disperse as soon as denisov began readinghis answer rostov noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen hadalready heard that story more than once and were tired of it only theman who had the next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bedgloomily frowning and smoking a pipe and little onearmed tushin stilllistened shaking his head disapprovingly in the middle of the readingthe uhlan interrupted denisovbut what i say is he said turning to rostov it would bebest simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewardswill now be distributed and surely a pardon would be grantedme petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to whichhe tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded likean expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber iwould ask mercy but im being courtmartialed for bwinging wobbersto book let them twy me im not afwaid of anyone ive servedthe tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to bedegwaded listen im witing to them stwaight this is what isay if i had wobbed the tweasuwyits certainly well written said tushin but thats notthe point vasili dmitrich and he also turned to rostov onehas to submit and vasili dmitrich doesnt want to you know theauditor told you it was a bad businesswell let it be bad said denisovthe auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushinand you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubthe indicating rostov has connections on the staff you wontfind a better opportunityhavent i said im not going to gwovel denisov interruptedhim went on reading his paperrostov had not the courage to persuade denisov though heinstinctively felt that the way advised by tushin and the otherofficers was the safest and though he would have been glad to be ofservice to denisov he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hastytemperwhen the reading of denisovs virulent reply which took more than anhour was over rostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the dayin a most dejected state of mind amid denisovs hospital comradeswho had gathered round him telling them what he knew and listening totheir stories denisov was moodily silent all the eveninglate in the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked denisovwhether he had no commission for himyes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officersand taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window wherehe had an inkpot and sat down to writeit seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall hesaid coming from the window and giving rostov a large envelope init was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor inwhich denisov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariatofficials simply asked for pardonhand it in it seemshe did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smilechapter xixhaving returned to the regiment and told the commander the state ofdenisovs affairs rostov rode to tilsit with the letter to theemperoron the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived intilsit boris drubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom hewas in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay attilsiti should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleonwhom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparteyou are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smilingboris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he wasbeing testedi am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied thegeneral patted him on the shoulder with a smileyou will go far he said and took him to tilsit with himboris was among the few present at the niemen on the day the twoemperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleonpass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw thepensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavernon the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleons arrival saw bothemperors get into boats and saw how napoleonreaching the raftfirststepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his handto him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begunto move in the highest circles boris had made it his habit to watchattentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the timeof the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come withnapoleon and about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively towords spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors wentinto the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look atit again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour andfiftythree minutes he noted this down that same evening among otherfacts he felt to be of historic importance as the emperors suitewas a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a man whovalued his success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion ofthis interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in thisboris felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had notonly become known but people had grown accustomed to him and acceptedhim twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself sothat the latter knew his face and all those at court far fromcoldshouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomerwould now have been surprised had he been absentboris lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinskizhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionatelyfond of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit frenchofficers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining andlunching with him and borison the evening of the twentyfourth of june count zhilinski arranged asupper for his french friends the guest of honor was an aidedecamp ofnapoleons there were also several french officers of the guardand a page of napoleons a young lad of an old aristocratic frenchfamily that same day rostov profiting by the darkness to avoid beingrecognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodgingoccupied by boris and zhilinskirostov in common with the whole army from which he came was farfrom having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and thefrenchwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsthat hadtaken place at headquarters and in boris in the army bonaparte andthe french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contemptand fear only recently talking with one of platovs cossackofficers rostov had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner hewould be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite latelyhappening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rostov hadmaintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimatesovereign and the criminal bonaparte rostov was therefore unpleasantlystruck by the presence of french officers in boris lodging dressedin uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different pointof view from the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a frenchofficer who thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling ofhostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenlyseized him he stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whetherdrubetskoy lived there boris hearing a strange voice in theanteroom came out to meet him an expression of annoyance showed itselffor a moment on his face on first recognizing rostovah its you very glad very glad to see you he said howevercoming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed his firstimpulseive come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i havebusiness he said coldlyno i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regimentdans un moment je suis a vous he said answering someone whocalled him in a minute i shall be at your disposali see im intruding rostov repeatedthe look of annoyance had already disappeared from boris facehaving evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly tookboth rostovs hands and led him into the next room his eyes lookingserenely and steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by somethingas if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed torostovoh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said borisand he led him into the room where the supper table was laid andintroduced him to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian butan hussar officer and an old friend of hiscount zhilinskile comte n nle capitaine s s said henaming his guests rostov looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowedreluctantly and remained silentzhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person verywillingly into his circle and did not speak to rostov boris did notappear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the samepleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with whichhe had met rostov tried to enliven the conversation one of thefrenchmen with the politeness characteristic of his countrymenaddressed the obstinately taciturn rostov saying that the latter hadprobably come to tilsit to see the emperorno i came on business replied rostov brieflyrostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look ofdissatisfaction on boris face and as always happens to those in abad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversionand that he was in everybodys way he really was in their way for healone took no part in the conversation which again became general thelooks the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sittinghere for he rose and went up to borisanyhow im in your way he said in a low tone come and talkover my business and ill go awayoh no not at all said boris but if you are tired come andlie down in my room and have a restyes reallythey went into the little room where boris slept rostov withoutsitting down began at once irritably as if boris were to blame insome way telling him about denisovs affair asking him whetherthrough his general he could and would intercede with the emperor ondenisovs behalf and get denisovs petition handed in when heand boris were alone rostov felt for the first time that he could notlook boris in the face without a sense of awkwardness boris with oneleg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slenderfingers of his right listened to rostov as a general listens to thereport of a subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight intorostovs eyes with the same veiled look each time this happenedrostov felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyesi have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severein such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before theemperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in generali thinkso you dont want to do anything well then say so rostovalmost shouted not looking boris in the faceboris smiledon the contrary i will do what i can only i thoughtat that moment zhilinskis voice was heard calling boriswell then go go go said rostov and refusing supper andremaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a longtime hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next roomchapter xxrostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petitionon denisovs behalf he could not himself go to the general inattendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permissionto do so and boris even had he wished to could not have done so onthe following day on that day june the preliminaries of peace weresigned the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the crossof the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of thefirst degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given bya battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion theemperors were to be present at that banquetrostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when thelatter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early nextmorning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and around hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and theiruniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and frenchemperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up andpreparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colorsdraped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms a and n inthe windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayedboris doesnt want to help me and i dont want to ask himthats settled thought nicholas all is over between us buti wont leave here without having done all i can for denisov andcertainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperorhe is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to thehouse where alexander lodgedsaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite wereassembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come outi may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i wereto hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they reallyarrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand onwhose side justice lies he understands everything knows everythingwho can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they didarrest me for being here what would it matter thought he lookingat an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied afterall people do go in its all nonsense ill go in and handthe letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy whodrives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did notexpect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight tothe houseno i wont miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitzhe thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious ofthe blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall athis feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will eventhank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice isthe greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying andpassing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porchof the emperors housea broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right hesaw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to thelower floorwhom do you want someone inquiredto hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholaswith a tremor in his voicea petition this way to the officer on duty he was shown thedoor leading downstairs only it wont be acceptedon hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at whathe was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was sofascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run awaybut the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostoventereda short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots anda batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in thatroom and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches anew pair of handsome silkembroidered braces that for some reasonattracted rostovs attention this man was speaking to someone in theadjoining rooma good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeingrostov he stopped short and frownedwhat is it a petitionwhat is it asked the person in the other roomanother petitioner answered the man with the bracestell him to come later hell be coming out directly we mustgolater later tomorrow its too laterostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stoppedhimwhom have you come from who are youi come from major denisov answered rostovare you an officerlieutenant count rostovwhat audacity hand it in through your commander and go along withyou go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handedhimrostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there weremany officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to passcursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of findinghimself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put toshame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the improprietyof his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes wasmaking his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when afamiliar voice called him and a hand detained himwhat are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deepvoiceit was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special favorduring this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division inwhich rostov was servingrostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindlyjocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voicetold him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whomthe general knew having
