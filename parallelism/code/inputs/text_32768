a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in thatrefined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought andwith the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importancewho had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovnakissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining headand complacently seated himself on the sofafirst of all dear friend tell

what has been decided about novosiltsevsdispatch you know everythingwhat can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listlesstone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte hasburnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn oursprince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stalepart anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty yearsoverflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and sometimes even when she did notfeel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though itdid not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressedas in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defectwhich she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary tocorrectin the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burstoutoh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understandthings but austria never has wished and does not wish for war sheis betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereignrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the onething i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to performthe noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god willnot forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and

her commercialspirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexandersloftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted tofind and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answerdid novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannotunderstand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing forhimself but only desires the good of mankind and what have theypromised nothing and what little they have promised they will notperform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible andthat all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe aword that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussianneutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the loftydestiny of our adored monarch he will save europeshe suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosityi think said the prince with a smile that if you had beensent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the kingof prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give mea cup of teain a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i amexpecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart whois connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the bestfrench families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones andalso the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has beenreceived by the emperor had you heardi shall be delighted to meet them said the prince buttell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only justoccurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chiefmotive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wantsbaron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by allaccounts is a poor creatureprince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others weretrying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it forthe baronanna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she noranyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or waspleased withbaron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by hersister was all she said in a dry and mournful toneas she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funkebeaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadnessthe prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly andcourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovnawished both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a manrecommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so shesaidnow about your family do you know that since your daughter cameout everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazinglybeautifulthe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitudei often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearerto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that politicaland social topics were ended and the time had come for intimateconversationi often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of lifeare distributed why has fate given you two such splendid childreni dont speak of anatole your youngest i dont like him sheadded in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrowstwo such charming children and really you appreciate them less thananyone and so you dont deserve to have themand she smiled her ecstatic smilei cant help it said the prince lavater would have said ilack the bump of paternitydont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you knowi am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and herface assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at hermajestys and you were pitiedthe prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantlyawaiting a reply he frownedwhat would you have me do he said at last you know i did alla father could for their education and they have both turned out foolshippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one thatis the only difference between them he said this smiling in a waymore natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles roundhis mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse andunpleasantand why are children born to such men as you if you were not afather there would be nothing i could reproach you with said annapavlovna looking up pensivelyi am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear thatis how i explain it to myself it cant be helpedhe said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture anna pavlovna meditatedhave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole sheasked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though idont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person whois very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princessmary bolkonskayaprince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory andperception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement ofthe head that he was considering this informationdo you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be infive years if he goes on like this presently he added thatswhat we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yoursrichher father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he isthe wellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army underthe late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he isvery clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl

his armchair looking in another directionattendez said anna pavlovna reflecting ill speak tolise young bolkonskis wife this very evening and perhaps thething can be arranged it shall be on your

woman in petersburgto each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen myaunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conductedhim or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in hercap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guestsbegan to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to heraunt anna pavlovna mentioned each ones name and then left themeach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom notone of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of themcared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful andsolemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them inthe same words about their health and her own and the health of hermajesty who thank god was better today and each visitorthough politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old womanwith a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did notreturn to her the whole eveningthe young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in agoldembroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which adelicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teethbut it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when sheoccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the casewith a thoroughly attractive woman her defectthe shortness of herupper lip and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special andpeculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this prettyyoung woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health andcarrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young oneswho looked at her after being in her company and talking to her alittle while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of lifeand health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smileand the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in aspecially amiable mood that daythe little princess went round the table with quick short swayingsteps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress satdown on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was apleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my worksaid she in french displaying her bag and addressing all presentmind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on meshe added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quitea small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and shespread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty graydress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breastsoyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyoneelse replied anna pavlovnayou know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still infrench turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is goingto get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for sheadded addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer sheturned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helenewhat a delightful woman this little princess is said princevasili to anna pavlovnaone of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man withclosecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionableat that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stoutyoung man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a wellknowngrandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young manhad not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had onlyjust returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was hisfirst appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod sheaccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite ofthis lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sightof something too large and unsuited to the place came over her facewhen she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger thanthe other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference tothe clever though shy but observant and natural expression whichdistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing roomit is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poorinvalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with heraunt as she conducted him to herpierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round asif in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the littleprincess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintanceanna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from theaunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys healthanna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know theabbe morio he is a most interesting manyes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is veryinteresting but hardly feasibleyou think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say somethingand get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre nowcommitted a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady beforeshe had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak toanother who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feetspread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbesplan chimericalwe will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smileand having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave sheresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch readyto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag asthe foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goesround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one thatcreaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check themachine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about herdrawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by aword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steadyproper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety aboutpierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approachedthe group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there andagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbepierre had been educated abroad and this reception at annapavlovnas was the first he had attended in russia he knew that allthe intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like achild in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missingany clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the selfconfidentand refined expression on the faces of those present he was alwaysexpecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to moriohere the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for anopportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doingchapter iiianna pavlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the auntbeside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company hadsettled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed roundthe abbe another of young people was grouped round the beautifulprincess helene prince vasilis daughter and the little princessbolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her agethe third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovnathe vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polishedmanners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out ofpoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up asa treat to her guests as a clever maitre dhotel serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it inthe kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna served up toher guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly choicemorsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing themurder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc denghienhad perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particularreasons for buonapartes hatred of himah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovnawith a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in thesound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomtethe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness tocomply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone tolisten to his talethe vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna toone of the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said sheto another how evidently he belongs to the best society said sheto a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beefon a hot dishthe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smilecome over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center ofanother groupthe princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with whichshe had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautifulwoman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with mossand ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparklingdiamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not lookingat any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each theprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shouldersback and bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very muchexposedand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her asshe moved toward anna pavlovna helene was so lovely that not onlydid she not show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she evenappeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty sheseemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effecthow lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted hisshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinarywhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with herunchanging smilemadame i doubt my ability before such an audience said hesmilingly inclining his headthe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considereda reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story wasbeing told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round armaltered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still morebeautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from timeto time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the storyproduced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted justthe expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsedinto her radiant smilethe little princess had also left the tea table and followed helenewait a moment ill get my work now then what are youthinking of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me myworkbagthere was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in herseatnow i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her workprince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle andmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside herle charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblanceto his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite ofthis resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like hissisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyousselfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by thewonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrarywas dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullenselfconfidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose andmouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his armsand legs always fell into unnatural positionsits not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speakwhy no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shouldersbecause i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered themhe spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be surewhether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed ina darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nympheeffrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockingsthe vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then currentto the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris tovisit mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonapartewho also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presencenapoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he wassubject and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter spared him andthis magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by deaththe story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies lookedagitatedcharming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princesscharming whispered the little princess sticking the needle intoher work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the storyprevented her from going on with itthe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he wastalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to therescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe aboutthe balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the youngmans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory bothwere talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was whyanna pavlovna disapprovedthe means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russiabarbaric as she is said to beto placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its objectthe maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save theworldbut how are you to get that balance pierre was beginningat that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely at pierreasked the italian how he stood russian climate the italiansface instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugaryexpression evidently habitual to him when conversing with womeni am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i have hadthe honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think ofthe climate said henot letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circlechapter ivjust then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrewbolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome youngman of medium height with firm clearcut features everything abouthim from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured stepoffered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it wasevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but hadfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen tothem and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemedto bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away fromher with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed annapavlovnas hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole companyyou are off to the war prince said anna pavlovnageneral kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressingthe last syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has beenpleased to take me as an aidedecampand lise your wifeshe will go to the countryare you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wifeandre said his wife addressing her husband in the samecoquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte hasbeen telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparteprince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who fromthe moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with gladaffectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked roundprince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever wastouching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming face he gave him anunexpectedly kind and pleasant smilethere now so you too are in the great world said he topierrei knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supperwith you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb thevicomte who was continuing his storyno impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressingpierres hand to show that there was no need to ask the question hewished to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and hisdaughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them passyou must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to thefrenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to preventhis rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives meof a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leaveyour enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovnahis daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightlyholding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still moreradiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturousalmost frightened eyes as she passed himvery lovely said prince andrewvery said pierrein passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to annapavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with mea whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in societynothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of cleverwomenanna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew hisfather to be a connection of prince vasilis the elderly lady whohad been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook princevasili in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumedhad left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxietyand fearhow about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him intothe anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me whatnews i may take back to my poor boyalthough prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politelyto the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him aningratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not goawaywhat would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then hewould be transferred to the guards at once said shebelieve me princess i am ready to do all i can answered princevasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i shouldadvise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that wouldbe the best waythe elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of thebest families in russia but she was poor and having long been out ofsociety had lost her former influential connections she had now come topetersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only sonit was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained aninvitation to anna pavlovnas reception and had sat listening tothe vicomtes story prince vasilis words frightened her anembittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a momentthen she smiled again and clutched prince vasilis arm more tightlylisten to me prince said she i have never yet asked youfor anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of myfathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake todo this for my sonand i shall

capital which has to be economizedif it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realizedthat if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon beunable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence butin princess drubetskayas case he felt after her second appealsomething like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what wasquite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps inhis career moreover he could see by her manners that she was one ofthose womenmostly motherswho having once made up their mindswill not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared ifnecessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and evento make scenes this last consideration moved himmy dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual
